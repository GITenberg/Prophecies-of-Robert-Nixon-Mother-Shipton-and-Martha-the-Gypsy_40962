<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>THE LIFE
OF ROBERT NIXON,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">COMMONLY CALLED</span><br />
THE CHESHIRE PROPHET.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prophecy of Nixon has so often
given a name to the productions of authors of different
principles, that it is now almost become a doubt whether such a
person ever existed.&nbsp; Passing through Cheshire lately,
curiosity led me to inquire what credit these legends bore among
the natives: and I was not a little surprised to find with what
confidence they related events which have come to pass within the
memory of many of the inhabitants; and how strictly they adhered
to the notion that he would not fail in the rest.&nbsp; Amongst
his number <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>was a namesake and descendant of the same family with
this famous idiot, who, at this time lives not far from
Vale-Royal, from whom I had mostly what follows, which he said he
had often heard his father and other ancient people in the
country relate.&nbsp; I also obtained a manuscript copy which
seemed to bear the appearance of antiquity.&mdash;Mr. Gerrard,
Mr. Grimes and many others of the inhabitants of the forest of
Delamere very obligingly told me what they knew, and confirmed
what was past.</p>
<p>John, or Jonathan Nixon, the father of our prophet was a
husbandman who held the lease of a farm from the abbey of
Vale-Royal, to this day known by the name of Bark, or
Bridge-house in the parish of Over near New-Church, and not far
from Vale-Royal, on the forest of Delamere, which house is still
kept up and venerated by the natives of Cheshire for nothing else
that I could hear of but this extraordinary person&rsquo;s birth,
which took place Whitsuntide, and he was christened by the name
of Robert, in the year 1467, about the 7th year of Edward IV.;
and from his infancy he was <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>remarkable for a stupidity and
invincible ignorance, so that it was with great difficulty his
parents could instruct him to drive the team, tend the cattle and
such sort of rustic employments.</p>
<p>His parents at their decease left the farm and our Robert very
young, to the care of an elder brother with whom he first gave an
instance of that foreknowledge which renders his name so
famous.</p>
<p>As he was driving the team one day, whilst his brother&rsquo;s
man guided the plough, he pricked an ox so very cruelly with his
goad that the plough-holder threatened to acquaint his master; on
which Nixon said, the ox should not be his brother&rsquo;s three
days hence; which accordingly happened for a life drooping in the
estate, the lord of the manor took the same ox for an heriot. <a
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>During his residence here he was chiefly distinguished for his
simplicity, seldom spoke, and when he did it was with so rough a
voice that it was painful to hear him; he was remarkably
satirical, and what <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>he said had generally some prophetic meaning.&nbsp; It
was about this time that the monk of Vale-Royal having displeased
him he said in an angry tone,</p>
<blockquote><p>When you the arrow come on high,<br />
Soon a raven&rsquo;s nest will be;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is well known to have come to pass in the person of the
last abbot of that place, whose name was Harrow.&nbsp; Being
called before Sir Thomas Holcroft he was put to death for denying
the supremacy of King Henry VIII.&nbsp; Having suppressed the
abbey the King gave the domain to this knight and his heirs who
bore a raven for their crest.</p>
<p>At another time he told them that Norton and Vale-Royal abbeys
should meet on Acton-bridge, a thing at that time looked upon as
improbable; yet those two abbeys being pulled down the stones
were used for the purpose of repairing the bridge; and what was
more improbable still a small thorn growing in the abbey-yard
would become its door.&nbsp; We may easily guess no one thought
this last would ever come to pass, <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>and especially as it was understood by
every one at that time of day that thorns never grew so large;
but this shows the uncertain meaning of a prophecy, and that what
we understand one way is possibly meant quite different; so it
happened in this case, for, at the Reformation the savage ravages
under the sanction of religion sought nothing but rapine and
plunder to enrich themselves; and under the name of banishing
superstition and pulling down idolatry, spared not even the most
revered lineaments of antiquity, the most sacred piles, the most
noble structures, or most valuable records, books written by our
most venerable forefathers and heroic ancestors.&nbsp; Pieces of
the nicest paint and figures of the best workmanship being all
lost, irrecoverably lost in one common fit of destructive zeal
which every hue and cry is too apt to raise in the breast of a
hot-headed bigot; whilst the truly religious, honest and learned
men regret to this day the loss those destructive times have
occasioned.&nbsp; Whilst these reached Vale-Royal, this thorn
amongst the rest, <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>being cut down was cast in the door-way, to prevent
sheep which grazed in the court from going in.</p>
<p>But the Reformation he declares in still plainer terms; for he
says,</p>
<blockquote><p>A time shall come when priests and monks<br />
Shall have no churches nor houses,<br />
And places where images stood,<br />
Lined letters shall be good,<br />
English books through churches are spread,<br />
Where shall be no holy bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not my intention to recite every particular he is said
to have foretold, which regard either private families or past
occasions&mdash;however, it may not be amiss to mention what is
fresh in every one&rsquo;s memory who lives near Delamere forest
and was vouched to me by several of the oldest inhabitants.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thro&rsquo; Weaver-hall shall be a lone <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a><br />
Ridley-pool shall be sown and mown,<br />
And Darnel-Park shall be hacked and hewn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two wings of Weaver-hall are now standing and between them
is a cart-road; Ridley-pool is filled up and made good <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>meadow land:
and in Darnel-Park the trees are cut down and it is made into
pasture-ground.</p>
<p>I was also assured that he foretold the use of broad wheels,
etc. and that the town of Northwich now a considerable place of
trade for salt will be destroyed by water, which is expected to
come to pass, by the natives of Cheshire, as much as any other
part of his prophecy has done; and some urge that the navigable
cuts lately made is the water meant: but whether a prejudice
against those useful improvements may not have given rise to this
notion, time only can determine.</p>
<p>But what rendered Nixon the most noticed was that at the time
when the battle of Bosworth-field was fought between King Richard
the Third and King Henry the Seventh, he stopped his team on a
sudden and pointing with his whip from one to the other cried,
&ldquo;Now, Richard!&nbsp; Now, Harry!&rdquo; several times; till
at last, he said, &ldquo;Now, Harry, get over that ditch and you
gain the day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The plough-holder, amazed, related
what had passed when he came <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>home, and the truth of the prediction
was verified by special messengers sent to announce the
proclamation of King Henry of England on the field of battle.</p>
<p>The messenger who went this circuit related on his return the
prediction of Nixon concerning the King&rsquo;s success; which,
though it had been confirmed by his arrival had made it no news
to the natives of those parts; but Henry perhaps the wisest
Prince of his time not willing to be deceived, nor yet doubting
the dispensations of Providence though by the mouth of a fool,
sent the same messenger back to find Nixon, and to bring him
before him.&nbsp; At the moment the King gave his orders our
prophet was in the town of Over, about which he ran like a madman
declaring the King had sent for him and that he must go to court
and there be <i>clammed</i>: that is, be starved to death.&nbsp;
Such a declaration caused a great deal of laughing in the town,
to think that his Majesty so noted for his wisdom should send for
a dirty drivelling clown to court, and that being sent for he
should fear to be starved there; but how great was their <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>surprise, in
a few days after, when the messenger passing through the town
demanded a guide to find Nixon who (then turning the spit at his
brother&rsquo;s at the Bark-house) cried, &ldquo;He is coming, he
is now on the road for me!&rdquo; but the astonishment of the
family can scarcely be imagined when, on the messenger&rsquo;s
arrival he demanded Nixon in the King&rsquo;s name; the people
who before scoffed at his simple appearance and odd sayings, and
had pointed to the very children to make him their sport were now
confounded on finding the most ridiculous of all he ever foretold
(in their opinion) become a truth, which was vouched to their own
eyes.&nbsp; Whilst hurried through the country Nixon still loudly
lamented that he was going to be starved at the court.</p>
<p>He had no sooner arrived there than the cautious King willing
to make trial of his foreknowledge devised the following scheme
to prove it.&nbsp; Having had a valuable diamond ring which he
commonly wore after the most seemingly strict inquiry made
through the palace whether any one had seen it; he sent for
Nixon, telling him <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>what a loss he had sustained, and that if he could not
help him to find it, he had no hopes left.&nbsp; But how much
surprised was the King, when he got for answer that old
proverb,</p>
<blockquote><p>He who hideth can find;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On which he declared with a smile that he had done this only
to try the prophet; but ever after ordered that what he said
should be carefully put in writing.</p>
<p>To prevent Nixon&rsquo;s being starved his Majesty gave orders
for him to have the liberty to range through the whole palace and
the kitchen was to be his more constant dwelling.&nbsp; Besides
which, an officer was appointed to take care that he was neither
misused or affronted by the servants, nor at loss for any
necessary of life.&nbsp; Thus situated one would have thought
want would never have reached him; yet one day, as the King was
going out to his hunting-seat Nixon ran to him crying and begged
in the most moving terms that he might not be left, for that if
he was his Majesty would never see him again alive: that he
should <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>be
starved; that now was the time, and if he was left he must
die.</p>
<p>The King whose thoughts were doubtless fixed on the diversion
he was going to and supposing the matter so very unlikely to come
to pass, only said that it was impossible and recommended him
strongly to the officer&rsquo;s care; but scarcely was the king
gone from the palace-gate when the servants mocked and teased
Nixon to such a degree, that the officer to prevent these insults
locked him up in a closet and suffered no one but himself to
attend on him thinking that he should prevent this part of his
prophecy coming true: but a message of great importance coming
from the King to this very officer, he in his readiness to obey
the royal command forgot to set poor Nixon at liberty and though
he was but three days absent when he recollected his prisoner he
found him at his return, dead as he had foretold of hunger.</p>
<p>Thus evidenced with what is past stands his prophecy in every
mouth in Cheshire; yet a greater affront cannot be given than to
ask a copy from the families said to be <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>possessed of
it.&nbsp; Every possible means it is well known has been used to
smother the truth, perplex the curious, and even to abolish the
very remembrance that such a one ever existed, but from what
reason cannot appear except that it is foretold that the heir of
O&mdash; is to meet with some ignominious death at his own gate,
<a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a> with other family events which, though
no person or time being perfectly distinguished may perhaps
occasion this secrecy.</p>
<p>I must also observe that the cross on Delamere forest, that
is, three steps and the socket in which the cross formerly stood
are now sunk within a few inches of the ground, though all
remember to have seen it within the memory of man nearly six feet
above, the cross itself having been destroyed long since.&nbsp;
It is also remarkable that Headlets cross is mentioned by Merlin
de Rymer and most other English and Scotch prophets as the last
place in England on which it is supposed a decisive <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>action will
happen; but as to any fixed period when the things will come to
pass I cannot learn, being all mentioned with the greatest
uncertainty.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With two heels on one foot,<br />
Who shall distinguish himself bravely,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shall be knighted by the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For it shall fall:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it fall

<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Then shall
the church be sunk for ever:<br />

Landlords shall stand, with hats in their hands,<br />
To desire tenants to hold their lands.</p>
<p class="poetry">Great wars and pressing of soldiers,<br />
But at last clubs and clouted shoes shall carry the day.<br />
It will be good in these days for a man to sell his goods, and
keep close at home.<br />
Then forty pounds in hand<br />
Will be better than forty pounds a year in land.<br />
The cock of the North shall be made to flee,<br />

<p>The famous Cheshire prophet Nixon, besides his prophecies
relative to the fate of private families, also predicted much of
public affairs, which we find literally verified by the
sequel.</p>
<p>On the Christmas before he went to court, being among the
servants at Mr. Cholmondeley&rsquo;s house, to the surprise of
them all he suddenly started up and said,</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

which they so wonderfully foretold, Nixon was silent, and
relapsed into his wonted stupidity: from which he did not recover
until many weeks after, when he became again inspired, and gave
vent to those remarkable predictions which were recollected by
Mr. <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

were taken down from the prophet&rsquo;s mouth by the steward, in

36</span>NIXON&rsquo;S CHESHIRE PROPHECY AT LARGE,<br />
FROM LADY COWPER&rsquo;S COPY;<br />
WITH HISTORICAL AND POLITICAL REMARKS, AND MANY INSTANCES<br />
WHEREIN IT HAS BEEN FULFILLED.</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>This remarkable Prophecy has been carefully revised,
corrected, and improved; also some account given of our author,
Robert Nixon, who was but a kind of idiot, and used to be <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>employed in
following the plough.&nbsp; He had lived in some farmers&rsquo;
families, and was their drudge and their jest.</p>
<p>At last, Thomas Cholmondeley, of Vale-Royal, Esq., took him
into his house, where he lived when he composed this prophecy,
which he delivered with as much gravity and solemnity as if he
had been an oracle; and it was observed that though the fool was
a driveller, and could not speak common sense when uninspired,
yet in delivering his prophecies, he spoke plainly and sensibly;
how truly will be seen in the following pages.</p>
<p>As to the credit of this prophecy I dare say it is as well
attested as any of Nostradamus&rsquo;s or Merlin&rsquo;s, and
will come to pass as well as the best of Squire
Bickerstaff&rsquo;s; it is plain enough that great men in all
ages had recourse to prophecy as well as the vulgar.&nbsp; I
would not have all grave persons despise the inspiration of
Nixon.&nbsp; The late French King gave audience to an <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>inspired
farrier, and rewarded him with an hundred pistoles for his
prophetical intelligence; though by what I can learn he did not
come near our Nixon for gifts.</p>
<p>The simplicity, the circumstances, and the history of the
Cheshire Prophecy are so remarkable that I hope the public will
be as much delighted as I was myself.</p>
<p>By the way, this is not a prophecy of to-day; &rsquo;tis as
old as the powder-plot, and the story will make it appear that
there is as little imposture in it as the Jacobites pretend there
is in the person it seems to have an eye to; but whether they are
both impostures alike or not I leave the reader to determine.</p>

<h3><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>THE
PROPHECY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the reign of King James the
First there lived a man generally reputed a fool, whose name was
Nixon.&nbsp; One day, when he returned home from ploughing, he
laid the things down which he had in his hands, and continued for
some time in a seemingly deep and thoughtful meditation, at
length he pronounced in a loud hoarse voice, &lsquo;Now I will
prophecy;&rsquo; and spoke as follows;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a raven shall build in a stone lion&rsquo;s mouth
on the top of a church in Cheshire, then a King of England shall
be driven out of his kingdom, and never return more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When an eagle shall sit on the top of the house, then
an heir shall be born to the Cholmondeley family, and this heir
shall live to see England invaded by foreigners, who shall
proceed as far <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>as a town in Cheshire; but a miller, named Peter, shall
be born with two heels on one foot, and at that time living in a
mill of Mr. Cholmondeley&rsquo;s he shall be instrumental in
delivering the nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person who then governs the nation will be in great
trouble, and skulk about:&mdash;The invading King shall be
killed, laid across a horse&rsquo;s back like a calf, and led in
triumph.&nbsp; The miller having been instrumental in it, shall
bring forth the person that then governs the kingdom, and be
knighted for what he has done; and after that England shall see
happy days.&nbsp; A new set of young men, of virtuous manners,
shall come, who shall prosper, and make a flourishing church for
two hundred years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a token of the truth of all this a wall of Mr.
Cholmondeley&rsquo;s shall fall, if it falls downwards, the
church shall be oppressed, and rise no more; but if it fall
upwards, next the rising <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>hill on the side of it, then shall it
flourish again.&nbsp; Under this wall shall be found the bones of
a British King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pond shall run with blood three days, and the Cross
stone Pillar in the forest sink so low into the ground, that a
crow from the top of it shall drink of the best blood in
England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A boy shall be born with three thumbs, and shall hold
three kings&rsquo; horses, while England shall be three times won
and lost in one day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The original may be seen in several families in the county,
and in particular in the hands of Mr. Egerton, of Oulton, with
many other remarkable things; as that Peckforton wind-mill should
be removed to Ludington hill and that horses saddled should run
about while their girths rotted away.&nbsp; But this is
sufficient to prove Nixon as great a prophet as Partridge; and <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>we shall give
other proofs of it before we have done with him.</p>
<p>I know your prophets are generally for Raw-head and
bloody-bones and therefore do not mind it much; or I might add
that of Oulton mill shall be driven with blood instead of water,
but these soothsayers are great butchers and every hall is with
them a slaughter-house.</p>
<p>Now as for authorities to prove this prophecy to be genuine
and how it has hitherto been accomplished, I might refer myself
to the whole country of Chester, where it is in every one&rsquo;s
mouth and has been so these forty years.&nbsp; As much as I have
of the manuscript was sent me by a person of sense and veracity
and as little partial to visions as any body.&nbsp; For my own
part I build nothing on this or any other prophecy; only there is
something so very odd in the story and so pat in the wording of
it that I cannot help giving it as I found it.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>The
family of the Cholmondeleys is very ancient in this county and
takes its name from a place so called near Nantwich; there are
also Cholmton and Cholmondeston; but the seat of that branch of
the family which kept our prophet Nixon is at Vale-Royal, on the
river Weave in Delamere forest.&nbsp; It was formerly an abbey,
<a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> founded by Edward I. and came to the
Cholmondeleys from the famous family of the Holcrofts.&nbsp; When
Nixon prophesied this family was near being extinct, the heir
having married Sir Walter St. John&rsquo;s daughter, a lady not
esteemed very young, who, notwithstanding, being with child, fell
in labour and continued so for many days, <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>during which
time an eagle sat upon the house-top and flew away when she was
delivered of a son.</p>
<p>A raven is also known to have built in a stone lion&rsquo;s
mouth in the steeple of the church of Over, in the forest of
Delamere.&nbsp; Not long before the abdication of King James the
wall spoken of fell down and fell upwards and in removing the
rubbish were found the bones of a man of more than ordinary
size.&nbsp; A pond at the same time ran with water that had a
reddish tincture and was never known to have done so before or
since.</p>
<p>Headless cross in the forest, which in the memory of man was
several feet high, is now only half a foot from the ground.</p>
<p>In the parish of Budworth a boy was born about eighteen years
ago with three thumbs; the youth is still living there and the
miller Peter lives in Noginshire mill in expectation of
fulfilling this prophecy on the person of <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Perkin: he
hath also two heels on one foot and I find he intends to make use
of them in the interest of King George, for he is a bold Briton
and a loyal subject, zealous for the Protestant succession in the
illustrious House of Hanover, has a vote for the knights of the
shire and never fails to give it on the right side: in a word,
Peter will prate or box for the good cause that Nixon had lifted
him in and if he does not do the business, this must be said of
him, that no man will bid fairer for it; which the Lady Egerton
was so apprehensive of, that wishing well to another restoration,
she often instigated her husband to turn him out of the mill; but
he looked upon it as whimsical and so Peter still continues
there, in hopes of being as good a knight as Sir Philip his
landlord was.</p>
<p>Of this Peter I have been told, that the Lady Narcliff of
Chelsea and the Lady St. John of Battersea, together with several
other persons of credit and <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>fashion, have often been heard to
talk and that they all asserted their knowledge of the truth of
our prophecy and its accomplishment, with many particulars that
are more extraordinary than any I have yet mentioned.</p>
<p>The noise of Nixon&rsquo;s Predictions reaching the ears of
King James the First, he would needs see this fool, who cried and
made ado that he might not go to court and the reason that he
gave was, that he should there be <span
class="GutSmall">STARVED</span>.&mdash;(A very whimsical fancy of
his, courts not being places where people are used to starve in,
when they once come there, whatever they may have done
before.)&mdash;The King being informed of Nixon&rsquo;s refusing
to come, said he would take particular care that he should not be
starved and ordered him to be brought up.&nbsp; Nixon cried out,
that he was sent for again; and soon after the messenger arrived,
who brought him up from Cheshire.</p>
<p>How or whether he prophecied to his <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>Majesty, no person can tell; but he
is not the first fool that has made a good court prophet.</p>
<p>That Nixon might be well provided for it was ordered that he
should be kept in the kitchen, where he grew so troublesome in
licking and picking the meat, that the cooks locked him up in a
hole; and the King going on a sudden from Hampton Court to London
in their hurry they forgot the fool and he was really starved to
death.</p>
<p>There are a great many passages of this fool-prophet&rsquo;s
life and sayings transmitted in tradition from father to son in
this county palatine; as, that when he lived with a farmer before
he was taken into Mr. Cholmondeley&rsquo;s family, he goaded an
ox so cruelly that one of the ploughmen threatened to beat him
for abusing his master&rsquo;s beast&mdash;Nixon said, &ldquo;My
master&rsquo;s beast will not be his three days.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
life in an estate dropping in at that time, the lord of the manor
took the same ox for a <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>heriot.&nbsp; This account whimsical
and romantic as it is was told to the Lady Cowper in the year
1670, by Dr. Patrick late Bishop of Ely then chaplain to Sir
Walter St. John; and that lady had the following further
particulars relating to this prophecy and the fulfilling of many
parts of it from Mrs. Chute, sister to Mrs. Cholmondeley of
Vale-Royal, who affirmed that a multitude of people gathered
together to see the eagle before-mentioned and the bird was
frightened from her young; that she herself was one of them and
the cry among the people was, Nixon&rsquo;s prophecy is fulfilled
and we have a foreign King.&nbsp; She declared that she read over
the prophecy many times when her sister was with child of the
heir who now enjoys the estate.&nbsp; She particularly remembers
that King James the Second was plainly pointed at and that it was
foretold he should endeavour to subvert the laws and religion of
this kingdom, for which <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>reason they would rise and turn him
out: that the eagle of which Nixon prophecied perched in one of
the windows all the time her sister was in labour.&nbsp; She says
it was the biggest bird she ever saw; that it was in a deep snow
and it perched on the edge of a great bow-window, which had a
large border on the outside and that she and many others opened
the window to try to scare it away, but it would not stir till
Mrs. Cholmondeley was delivered; after which it took flight to a
great tree over against the room her sister lay in, where having
stayed about three days it flew away in the night.&nbsp; She
affirmed further to the Lady Cowper, that the falling of the
garden wall was a thing not to be questioned, it being in so many
people&rsquo;s memory that it was foretold that the heir of
Vale-Royal should live to see England invaded by foreigners and
that he should fight bravely for his King and Country: that the
miller <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>mentioned is now alive and expects to be knighted and is
in the very mill that is foretold: that he should kill two
invaders who should come in, the one from the West and the other
from the North: that he from the North should bring with him of
all nations, Swedes, Danes, Germans, and Dutch; and that in the
folds of his garments he should bring fire and famine, plague and
murder: that many great battles should be fought in England, one
upon London-bridge, which should be so bloody, that people will
ride in London streets up to their horses&rsquo; bellies in
blood; that several other battles should be fought up and down
most parts of Cheshire; and that the last that ever would be
fought in England should be on Delamere forest: that the heir of
Oulston, whose name is E&mdash; and has married Earl
Cholmondeley&rsquo;s sister, should be hanged up at his own
gate.</p>
<p>Lastly, Nixon foretells great glory <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>and prosperity to those who stand up
in defence of their laws and liberties; and ruin and misery to
those who should betray them.&nbsp; He says, the year before this
would happen, bread corn would be very dear and that the year
following more troubles should begin which would last three
years; that the first would be moderate, the second bloody, and
the third intolerable; that unless they were shortened no mortal
could bear them; and that there were no mischiefs but what poor
England would feel at that time.&nbsp; But that GEORGE the SON of
GEORGE, <a name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a> should put an end to all.&nbsp; That
afterwards the church should flourish, and England be the most
glorious nation on earth.</p>
<p>Lady Cowper was not content to take these particulars from
Mrs. Chute, but she enquired of Sir Thomas Aston, of the truth of
this prophecy and he <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>attested it was in great reputation
in Cheshire and that the facts were known by every one to have
happened as Nixon said they would; adding, that the morning
before the garden wall fell, his neighbour Mr. Cholmondeley,
going to ride out a hunting, said &ldquo;Nixon seldom fails but
now I think he will; for he foretold that this day my garden wall
would fall and I think it looks as if it would stand these forty
years;&rdquo; that he had not been gone above a quarter of an
hour before the wall split and fell upwards against the rising of
the hill, which as Nixon would have it, was the presage of a
flourishing church.</p>
<p>As to the removal of Peckforton-mill, it was done by Sir John
Crew, the mill having lost its trade there, for which he ordered
it to be set upon Ludington hill; and being asked if he did it to
fulfil the prophecy, he declared he never thought of it.&nbsp; I
myself have inquired of a person who knows <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Mr.
Cholmondeley&rsquo;s pond as well as Rosamond&rsquo;s in St.
James&rsquo;s Park and he assured me the falling of the wall and
the pond running blood, (as they call it) are facts which in
Cheshire any one would be reckoned mad for making the least
question of them.&nbsp; As there are several particulars in this
prophecy which remain unfulfilled; so when they come to pass,
some other circumstances may be added, which are not convenient
to be told until accomplished.</p>
<p>If I had a mind to look into the antiquities of this county, I
might find that prodigies and prophecies are no unusual things
there.&nbsp; Camden tells us that at Brereton not many miles from
Vale-Royal which gave name to a famous, ancient, numerous, and
knightly family, there is a thing as strange as that of the
eagle, or the falling of the wall, which he says was attested to
him by many persons and was commonly believed; that before any
heir <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>of
this family dies there are seen, in a lake adjoining the bodies
of trees swimming upon the water for several days together.&nbsp;
He likewise adds that near the abbey of St. Maurice in Burgundy
there is a fish-pond in which a number of fish are put equal to
the number of monks of that place; and if any one of them happens
to be sick, there is a fish seen floating on the surface of the
water; and in case the fit of sickness proves fatal to the monk,
the fish foretells it by its death some days before.&nbsp; This
the learned Camden relates in his description of Cheshire and the
opinion of the trees swimming in the lake near Brereton, prevails
all about the county to the present day, only with this
difference, that some say it is one log only that swims and some
say many.</p>
<p>Lancashire, which is not far off, has been famous for witches
and I am afraid Cheshire is a little infected by its
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Those that will <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>not believe our prophecy may leave it

<h2>A true and particular Account of a strange and surprising
Vision, that was seen in the Forest of Delamere, in Cheshire, on
the 4th of last Month.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Nixon, in the reign of King
James the First, prophesied of many strange and wonderful things
that should come to pass, such as an heir being born to Lord
Cholmondeley&rsquo;s which at that time there was little reason
to expect, but which came to pass; and that the eldest son or
young Lord Cholmondeley should have the misfortune to break his
neck by riding a hunting, which accident really did happen; <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>and several
other things already come to pass according to the said prophecy,
but, in particular, of a wonderful battle or engagement that
should be fought in the forest of Delamere; and as it is now
fully expected that we shall have an invasion from our natural
and inveterate enemies the French, it is also thought it will be
in the North of England and in all probability the said Forest of
Delamere may be the place of action or engagement: and what
strengthens the belief more is the vision that was seen in the
said forest on the 4th, as follows:</p>
<p>As two ancient persons were walking over the said Forest, to
their great surprise, they saw at a distance before them an army
rise out of the ground drawn up with their proper officers and
their commanders in front of them, and whilst they were looking
at and ruminating upon so strange a sight, to their most
wonderful surprise and amazement there arose also <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>another army
out of the ground, at a small distance from the first, and
farther in the forest, which army was headed or commanded by a
man in royal apparel, who, after having drawn up his army,
marched to meet and engage the first; upon which a most bloody
battle ensued with firearms, and many appeared to be killed on
both sides; but, being so near each other, they laid down or
grounded their arms and took to their swords, with which great
slaughter was made; and then came to such close quarters that
they put up their swords and fought with their hands; all of
which engagements continued more than three quarters of an hour,
during which time the said two ancient people were spectators;
and at last the remains of the army that first appeared retreated
towards the sea, and vanished directly out of their sight; whilst
the other army which was commanded by the man in royal apparel
marched <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>victorious out of the field as far as it was possible to
see them.&nbsp; These ancient people having spoken of the above
vision it came to the ears of several gentlemen, who sent for,
and examined them concerning the truth of it, which they were
ready to make oath of for their satisfaction.</p>
<p>On the 6th of the same month, as seven men were going to
Cheshire over the said forest, about the middle of it they saw to
their astonishment, a vision much resembling that which was on
the sixth as above described; only with this addition that the
victorious army had many slain to all appearance, yet they
resumed life again and joined their own army; all which is looked
upon as a good omen, that if in case England is invaded by her
enemies though the nation be seemingly dead and in great
division, yet on the approach of the enemy they will all in one
general heart and one mind exert <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>themselves to repel our most
inveterate enemies.</p>
<p>As Nixon&rsquo;s Prophecies are by some persons thought
fables, yet by what has come to pass it is now thought and very
plainly appears that most of them have or will prove true; for
which reason we have all occasion not only to exert our utmost
might to repel by force our enemies, but to return from our
abandoned and wicked course of life, and make our continual
prayers to God for protection and safety.</p>

61</span>PROPHECY<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
FRENCH REVOLUTION,<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FROM A PUBLICATION BY</span><br />
THE LATE MR. PETER JURIEU,<br />
IN 1687.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Rev. xi. 13.</p>
<p><i>And the same hour there was a great earthquake</i>, <i>and
the tenth part of the city fell</i>, <i>and in the earthquake
were slain of men seven thousand</i>, <i>and the remnant were
affrighted</i>, <i>and gave glory to God</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> what is the tenth part of the
city which shall fall? in my opinion we <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>cannot doubt
that it is France.&nbsp; This kingdom is the most considerable
part or piece of the ten horns, or states, which once made up the
great Babylonian city: it fell; this does not signify that the
French Monarchy shall be ruined: it may be humbled; but in all
appearance Providence does design a great elevation for her
afterwards.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis highly probable that God will not
let go unpunished the horrible outrages which it acts at this
day.&nbsp; Afterward, it must build its greatness upon the ruins
of the papal empire and enrich itself with the spoils of those
who shall take part with the papacy.&nbsp; They who at this day
persecute the protestants know not whither God is leading them:
this is not the way by which he will lead France to the height of
glory.&nbsp; If she comes thither it is because she shall shortly
change her road.&nbsp; Her greatening will be no damage to
protestant states; on the contrary, the protestant states shall
be enriched with <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>the spoil of others and be strengthened by the fall of
Antichrist&rsquo;s empire.&nbsp; This tenth part of the city
shall fall, with respect to the papacy; it shall break with Rome
and the Roman religion.&nbsp; One thing is certain, that the
Babylonian empire shall perish through the refusal of obedience
by the ten Kings, who had given their power to the beast.&nbsp;
This thing is already come to pass in part.&nbsp; The kingdoms of
Sweden, Denmark, England and several sovereign States in Germany
have withdrawn themselves from the jurisdiction of the
Pope.&nbsp; They have spoiled the harlot of her riches.&nbsp;
They have eaten her flesh, i.e. seized on her benefices, and
revenues, which she had in their countries.&nbsp; This must go on
and be finished as it is begun.&nbsp; The Kings who yet remain
under the empire of Rome must break with her, leave her solitary
and desolate.</p>
<p>But who must begin this last revolt? it is most probable that
France <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>shall.&nbsp; Not Spain, which as yet is plunged in
superstition and is as much under the tyranny of the clergy as
ever.&nbsp; Not the Emperor, who in temporal matters is subject
to the Pope and permits that in his states the Archbishop of
Strigonium should teach that the Pope can take away the Imperial
crown from him.&nbsp; It cannot be any country but France, which
a long time ago hath begun to shake off the yoke of Rome.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis well known how solemnly and openly war hath been
declared against the Pope by a declaration of the King (ratified
in all the parliaments) by the decisions of the assembly of the
French Clergy, by a disputation against the authority of the
Pope, managed in the Sorbonne, solemnly and by order of the
court.&nbsp; And to heighten the affront the theses were posted
up even upon the gates of his Nuncio.&nbsp; Nothing of this kind
had hitherto happened at least in a time of peace and <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>unless the
Pope had given occasion by his insolence.</p>
<p>Besides this superstition and idolatry lose their credit much
in France.&mdash;There is a secret party, though well enough
known, which greatly despiseth the popular devotions, images,
worship of saints, and is convinced that these are human
inventions: God is beforehand preparing for his great work.</p>
<p>To this it may be objected that for the last hundred and fifty
years the Pope&rsquo;s empire hath not been made up of ten Kings,
because the Kings of England, Sweden, Denmark, etc., have thrown
off his government; and consequently, France is not at this day
the tenth part of the Babylonian empire; for it is more than a
tenth part of it.&nbsp; But this is no difficulty; for we must
know, that things retain the names which they bore in their
original (without regarding the alterations which time does bring
along.)&nbsp; Though at this day there are not ten kingdoms <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>under the
Babylonian empire, it is, notwithstanding, certain, that each
kingdom was called, and ought to be called in this prophecy, the
tenth part, because the prophet having described this empire in
its beginning, by its ten horns, or ten kings, it is necessary
for our clear understanding, that every one of these Kings and
kingdoms, should be called one of the ten Kings, or of ten
kingdoms, with respect to the original constitution of the
Antichristian empire.</p>
<p>Seeing the tenth part of the city that must fall, is France,
this gives me some hopes that the death of the two witnesses hath
a particular relation to this kingdom.&nbsp; It is the street or
place of this city, i.e. the most fair and eminent part of
it.&nbsp; The witnesses must remain dead upon the street and upon
it they must be raised again.&nbsp; And as the death of the
witnesses and their resurrection have a relation to the kingdom
of France, it may well <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>fall out, that we may not be far
distant from the time of the resurrection of the witnesses,
seeing the three years and a half of their death are either
begun, or will begin shortly.</p>
<p>And in the earthquake were slain seven thousand; in the Greek
it is seven thousand names of men, and not seven thousand
men.&nbsp; I confess that this seems somewhat mysterious: in
other places we find not this phrase, names of men, but simply
men.&nbsp; Perhaps there is a figure of grammar, called
<i>hypolage casus</i>, so that names of men are put for men of
name, i.e. of raised and considerable quality, be it on account
of riches, or of dignity, or of learning.&nbsp; But I am more
inclined to say, that here these names of men, must be taken in
their natural signification and do intimate that the total
Reformation of France shall not be made with bloodshed, nothing
shall be destroyed but names; such as are the names of Monks, of
Carmelites, of <a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Augustines, of Dominicans, of Jacobins, of Franciscans,
Capuchins, Jesuits, Minimes and an infinite company of others,
whose number it is not easy to define and which the Holy Ghost
denotes by the number seven, which is the number of perfection,
to signify that the orders of monks and nuns shall perish for
ever.&nbsp; This is an institution so degenerated from its first
original, that it is become the ruin of Antichrist.&nbsp; These
orders cannot perish one without the other.</p>
<p>These great events deserve to be distinguished from all
others; for they have changed, or shall change, <span

DR. JOHN GILL.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some times fixed in
prophecy, which by diligence, attention, and application men may
arrive to some understanding of.&nbsp; There are indeed some
times and seasons, the knowledge of which is not to be attained
unto; and it would be wrong, as well as in vain, curiously to
search into them.&nbsp; <i>It is not for us to know the times or
the seasons</i>, <i>which the Father hath put in his own
power</i>; for <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>he has <i>determined the times before appointed</i>,
when every thing that he has purposed or promised shall come to
pass; and he has fixed a <i>time for every purpose under the
heaven</i>, for the performance of every thing he has designed
shall be; <i>a time to be born</i>, <i>and a time to die</i>, and
for every intermediate event; but these times are not known
beforehand, until things are brought into execution.&nbsp; There
are others and very remarkable events, the times of which are
pointed at in prophecy; and which with diligence and application,
a knowledge of them may in some measure be attained unto: as for
instance, the first coming of Christ into this world to save men:
the time for it was not only agreed upon and settled between the
Father and the Son, called <i>the fulness of time</i>, but there
were several prophetic hints of it; nay, not only was it
described by some general circumstances, as that it should be
before the second temple <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>was destroyed, since he was to come
into it and while the sceptre was in the tribe of Judah; but the
precise time was fixed by Daniel&rsquo;s seventy weeks, or four
hundred years, which were to commence from a date given him; and
before the expiration of which the Messiah was to come: and so as
he by reading Jeremiah&rsquo;s books knew the time when the
Babylonish captivity should end; another by reading his
prophecies might know when the Messiah would come; and
accordingly about the time when those weeks were drawing near to
an expiration, there were many that were looking for the Messiah
and redemption by him, as knowing that it was about the time by
these weeks that he should come.&nbsp; There is a time set for
the second coming and God in his times will show him, or cause
him openly to appear; and though he will come in an hour we know
not of, yet there are some circumstances pointed out in the <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>word of God
by which it may be known that it is nigh at hand; as that the day
when the Son of man shall be revealed shall be as the days of
Noah and Lot, when men indulged themselves in pleasure, lived in
great security, unaware of the ruin coming upon them; and that
when the Son of man cometh, faith will not be found in the earth;
whether this be understood of the grace or doctrine of faith, or
of faith with respect to Christ&rsquo;s coming: and when we
compare these things with the present times, and consider the
luxury, love of pleasure, carnal security and infidelity that
abound among us, we might conclude that the coming of Christ is
just at hand, were it not that there are many things which
require time yet to be fulfilled previous to it, as the
destruction of Antichrist, the conversion of the Jews, and the
bringing in of the fulness of the Gentiles.&nbsp; So the last
judgment which will take place at the second <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>coming of
Christ, and is most certain, being early known and often spoken
of.&nbsp; Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophecied of it, and of
Christ&rsquo;s coming to it; the day is appointed when it will
come on, though of that day and hour knoweth no man, not the
angels in heaven, but the Father only: but then the principal
things that should come to pass, relative to the church, between
the first and second coming of Christ to judgment, are signified
to us in the book of the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Sermon from</i> 1 <i>Chron.</i>
xii. 32,<br />
<i>preached Jan.</i> 1, 1752.</p>
<p>The destruction of Antichrist is the grand leading event to
the glories of this state.&nbsp; This is hinted at in the epistle
to the church at Philadelphus, the emblem of the spiritual reign;
it will be the last struggle of the beast that will cause that
<i>hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to
try</i> <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>the inhabitants of it: when the seventh trumpet will be
sounded, which will bring on the spiritual kingdom of Christ
throughout the world, he will destroy them which destroy the
earth; meaning the Papists, who have destroyed the inhabitants of
the earth with their false doctrine, superstitious worship, and
with those bloody wars, murders, and massacres they have been at
the bottom of.&nbsp; And till this is done the spiritual reign
cannot take place, especially in its full compass, and in all its
branches, for so long as Antichrist reigns, the church will be
more or less in an afflicted state: the date of the
church&rsquo;s troubles, and of the reign of Antichrist are
alike, and will expire together: the power given to the beast is
to continue forty and two months; wherefore there can be no truly
good and happy days, till these dates are ended.</p>
<p>The destruction of Antichrist will be by the spirit of
Christ&rsquo;s mouth, and the <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>brightness of his coming; that is, by
his coming in a spiritual way; or through the word of his mouth,
his gospel attended by his spirit and power; which will shine out
with so much lustre, splendour, light, and glory, as will chase
away the darkness of popery, and enlighten the minds of people,
to see into all the fopperies, absurdities, and wickedness of
that religion and cause them to cast it off: yea, even to open
the eyes of the kings and princes of the earth, to behold and
loath the abominations of the whore of Rome they have committed
fornication with; and fill them with wrath and indignation
against her, as to hate her, make her bare and desolate, and burn
her with fire.</p>
<p>This work will be greatly effected by the pouring out of the
seven vials of God&rsquo;s wrath, or the inflicting the seven
last plagues upon the anti-Christian states, upon the western and
eastern Antichrist, the Pope and Turk; who <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>must be both
removed to make way for the spiritual reign of Christ.&nbsp;
These seven vials will be poured out, or those plagues inflicted
by Angels; by whom we are to understand protestant kings, and
princes, and generals of armies; and these will be given them by
one or the first of the four beasts, or living creatures, the
emblems of gospel ministers; who having some notice of the time
of antichrist&rsquo;s destruction being at hand, will stir and
animate the christian princes and potentates to take this work in
hand; and who are therefore said to go forth from the temple, the
church, the place of divine and spiritual worship, and where they
themselves are worshippers; and from whence they have orders to
go forth and do their work.</p>
<p>The first five of these vials concern the western Antichrist,
and his dominions: between which, and the trumpets, there is a
great correspondence, though they respect different times and <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>persons.&nbsp; The first vial will be poured out upon
the earth, and designs those popish countries which are upon the
continent, as France and Germany, especially the latter; and as
the first trumpet brought the Goths into Germany, so the first
vial will bring great distress upon the popish party in the
empire, and issue in a reformation from popery.&nbsp; The second
vial will be poured out upon the sea, and may intend the maritime
powers belonging to the see of Rome, particularly Spain and
Portugal; and as the second trumpet brought the Vandals into
these places, so this vial will effect the same, and bring wars
and desolations into them, and make a change in their
religion.&nbsp; The third vial will be poured out upon the rivers
and fountains of water, which may point to those places adjacent
to Rome, as Italy and Savoy; and as the third trumpet brought the
Huns into those parts; so this vial will bring in large armies
hither, which will <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>cause much bloodshed, and a great revolution in church
and state.&nbsp; The fourth vial will be poured out upon the sun,
which must denote some person or persons of great dignity and
influence, and as the fourth trumpet brought destruction upon the
Emperor of Rome, the sun of the empire, and upon governors under
him, signified by the moon and stars; this vial will bring on the
ruin of the pope of Rome, the sun of the antichristian empire,
with all his cardinals, bishops, priests, etc.&nbsp; The fifth
vial will be poured out upon the seat of the beast, which is
Rome, the seat that the devil gave to the beast, and will produce
great darkness in his kingdom; though as yet it will not be
utterly destroyed, which is reserved to the seventh vial.&nbsp;
Now these several vials as they will be so many plagues on the
western Antichrist, and make so many breaches and ruins upon his
states and dominions, so they will be so many gradual steps to
the <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>advancement of the glory and kingdom of Christ, and
issue in the reformation of these places from popery.&nbsp; The
sixth vial will be poured out on the river Euphrates, which
designs the Turkish empire, in the midst of which that river is;
and as the sixth trumpet let loose the four angels, or heads of
the Ottoman family into Europe, so this vial affects the same
empire and brings destruction on it, signified by the drying up
of the waters of that river, as Babylon&rsquo;s destruction is
expressed by the drying up of her sea, Jer. li. 36, which will
make way for the king, or kingdoms of the East; the kingdoms of
Persia and Tartary and others, to receive and embrace the
Christian religion: this is the second, or Turkish woe, which
shall pass away; when the kingdoms of this world will become
Christ&rsquo;s and his dominion will be from sea to sea, from the
Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Sea; and from the river
Euphrates to <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>the ends of the earth.&nbsp; The seventh vial will be
poured out upon the air, the whole kingdom of Satan, in all the
branches of it, who is the prince of the power of the air; and
this vial will clear the whole world of all the remains of
Christ&rsquo;s enemies, pagan, papal, and Mahometon, which the
other vials left or did not reach; and now will Christ&rsquo;s
kingdom be in its full glory.&nbsp; Now the heathens, papists,
pagans and Mahometans, will perish out of this land and these
sorts of sinners will be consumed out of the earth and such
wicked ones will be no more.</p>
<p>God will make a short work in righteousness, upon the enemies
of his church: as yet I take it, none of them are poured out,
though some great and learned men have so thought; as yet there
have been no such devastations on the continent, as in France and
Germany, as to produce the above effects; nor in the countries of
Spain and Portugal; nor in Italy and Savoy, <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>and like the
places near Rome, nor in the seat of the beast, Rome itself; nor
on the Pope and his cardinals; the river Euphrates is not dried
up; the Ottoman empire is yet in being; the Turkish woe is not
passed away; and much less the world cleared of all the enemies
of Christ and his church; no, before this work is done, the outer
court must be given to the Gentiles, and the witnesses must be
slain.&nbsp; Had they begun to be poured out at the time of the
reformation, as some have thought, in all likelihood they would
have been finished before now; and Antichrist would have been
destroyed, and better times than we are now in would have
succeeded; but, however, this we may be assured of, that as the
plagues in Egypt issued in the destruction of Pharaoh, and in the
deliverance of the Israelites, so these vials will end in the
ruin of Antichrist, and in the salvation of the church of
Christ.&nbsp; As soon as these things will take place, <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>nay, as soon
as you hear of those seven plagues, immediately you hear of
persons on a sea of glass, triumphing over Antichrist, having the
harps of God, and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb: and no
sooner it is said, that Babylon is fallen, but voices are heard
in heaven ascribing salvation, glory, honour and power to God,
for his judgments on the great whore; declaring that the Lord God
omnipotent reigneth; that the marriage of the Lamb is come; and
his bride made ready; and proclaiming them happy that are called
to the marriage-supper of the Lamb; all which respect the
spiritual reign of Christ, now introduced by the ruin of
Antichrist.</p>
<p>There will be very large conversions every where, in the
several parts of the world: in all popish countries and
antichristian states; even the ten kings that have given their
kingdoms to the beast, have been associates of Antichrist and
reigned with him, shall <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>withdraw from him; they and their
subjects shall revolt from him, and be converted, and embrace the
pure gospel: as it will be the christian princes and potentates
that will pour out the seven vials on Antichrist, they will carry
the gospel with them wherever they go; or, however, the ministers
of it will follow closely at their heels, way being made by the
former for them; whose ministry will meet with great success
every where, and those that escape the judgments of God in these
nations, will not only be affrighted at them, but will be truly
converted by the gospel and give glory to the God of
heaven.&nbsp; In the Mahometan nations, the Turkish woe being
past and that empire being destroyed and way made for the gospel
to be carried into the eastern kingdoms, great and large
conversions will be made by it; there is a most glaring prophecy
of this in Isa. lx. 7., which whole chapter concerns the
spiritual and personal <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>reign of Christ; all the flocks of
Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth
shall minister unto thee; they shall come up with acceptance on
mine altar and I will glorify the house of my glory.&nbsp; Now
Kedar and Nebaioth were the sons of Ishmael, Gen. xxv. 13., who
settled in Arabia, the country now possessed by the Turks; so
that this is a prophecy of the conversion of multitudes in those
parts, whereby the interest of Christ will be increased and his
church glorified.&nbsp; Moreover, in all Pagan countries the
gospel will make its way, and be successful; the covering and
veil of blindness and ignorance, cast and spread over all people
and nations, will be removed by it; not only the darkness of
popery and Mahometanism, but the gross darkness of paganism shall
flee away at the light and brightness of Zion&rsquo;s rising; the
Gentiles shall come to it; the fulness and forces of them shall
be brought <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>into the church, being converted by the word: and not
only vast multitudes of the common people but great personages
also; kings shall be enlightened by it; these shall come to
Christ, fall down before him and worship him; these shall come
into his church and become members of it; kings shall be nursing
fathers and queens nursing mothers to his people; they shall
bring their riches, honour, and glory into his house; and his
saints shall suck the breasts of kings, be enriched, honoured and
protected by them.&nbsp; This will be the time when the kingdom
and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole
heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most
High; not that there will be any change or alteration in the form
and order of civil government, which will be the same as now;
there will be kings and queens then, as at this time, as these
prophecies show, it will not be until the personal <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>reign of
Christ takes place, that all rule, authority and power, will be
put down: civil magistracy in the spiritual reign will continue
as it is; only it will change hands, it will be entirely in the
hands of christian kings and princes all the world over; and no
doubt but it will be better exercised, be more orderly and
regular; and that truth and righteousness will prevail every
where.&nbsp; But I must not forget the conversion of that
considerable body of people the Jews, who have been preserved a
distinct people for several hundreds of years for this purpose;
the conversion of these people will be sudden and of them
altogether a nation shall be born at once.&nbsp; It looks as if
their conversion would be like that of the apostle Paul, and he
seems to hint that it will, when he says, that he, in obtaining
mercy, was a pattern to them which should hereafter believe;
meaning, perhaps, his own countrymen that should believe <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>in Christ in
the latter day, whose conversion would be similar to his; that as
his conversion was sudden, in the midst of all his ignorance,
unbelief, and rebellion, and without the word, by the immediate
power and grace of God, so will theirs be in like manner: nor is
it likely that their conversion should be by means of the word,
since there is such an aversion in that people to the hearing of
it; and a rare thing it is to see a Jew in a Christian
assembly.&nbsp; But, however, all Israel shall be called,
converted, and saved; there is a famous prophecy of this in Hos.
iii. 4, 5., in the first of these verses it is said, the children
of Israel shall abide many days without a king and without a
prince; without any civil government of their own, the sceptre
having departed from them many hundred years ago; and without
sacrifice; daily or yearly, or on any occasion: they believing it
to be unlawful to sacrifice any where but in <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>their own
land, and at Jerusalem, and on the altar of God there; and
without an image, and without an ephod, and without seraphim;
without any manner of idols, or idol-worship; they being not
addicted to idolatry, since their return from the Babylonish
captivity: and now as all these things are exactly fulfilled in
them, so will in like manner that which follows: afterwards shall
the children of Israel return: by faith and repentance, from
their evil way, from their impenitence and unbelief, and
rejection of the Messiah, and seek the Lord their God, and David
their king; the Messiah, the son of David, their king, as their
own <i>Targum</i> paraphrases it; and shall fear the Lord and his
goodness in the latter days; in the spiritual reign of Christ;
and it is hinted as in the Philadelphian state, Rev. iii. 9, then
will the children of Israel appoint themselves one head, which is
Christ, whom they will own and acknowledge to be their head,
lord, and <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>king; and they shall come out of the land, or countries
where they are, to their own land, and great shall be the day of
Jezreel: and this will make a considerable part of the glory of
Christ&rsquo;s spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p>The light of the gospel, both in the preachers and professors
of it, will be very great, clear, and distinct; the light of the
moon, as in the present dispensation to which it may be compared,
shall be as the light of the sun, to which that dispensation
shall be like; and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as
the light of seven days: as if the light of seven days were
collected together, and shone out at once; hyperbolical
expressions, setting forth the exceeding greatness of gospel
light in those times: not only the watchmen, ministers of the
word, shall see eye to eye, all truths clearly and distinctly,
but their ideas and sentiments shall be regular and uniform;
there will be an entire harmony and agreement <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>between them;
and even private Christians, common members, shall all know the
Lord, and the things of the gospel, in a very clear and
comfortable manner, even from the least of them unto the greatest
of them; when God shall lay Zion&rsquo;s stones with fair
colours, and her foundation with sapphires, make her windows of
agates, and her gates of carbuncles, and all her borders of
pleasant stones; then all her children shall be taught of God, to
such a degree as they never were before, so clearly, fully and
universally.</p>
<p>Brotherly love, which is now waxed cold, will be in its height
and glory, agreeable to the name of this state, Philadelphia,
which signifies brotherly love: there will be no more
contentions, animosities, and quarrels: Ephraim shall not envy
Judah on account of pre-eminence of office, gifts and grace; and
Judah shall not envy Ephraim, by any haughty or overbearing
carriage, or with wrangling debates and <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>opprobrious
language: the two sticks of Ephraim and Judah shall be one in the
hand of the Lord; there will be perfect harmony and love, nothing
to disturb, distress, and make uneasy, or tend to alienate the
affections of one from another; there will be no pricking briars
nor grieving thorns among them; they will be like the first
Christians, of one heart and of one mind, and of one judgment,
all studying to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of
peace.</p>
<p>Holiness, which becomes the house of God for ever, will now
adorn every member in it; nor will there be such immorality in
the world as at this present time: holiness will be as common as
profaneness is now; in that day there shall be upon the bells of
the horses holiness to the Lord&mdash;yea, every pot in Jerusalem
and in Judah, shall be holiness unto the Lord of hosts: Christ
therefore takes his titles in writing to the church at
Philadelphia, the emblem of the spiritual reign, suitable to its
<a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>state; as
truth and holiness shall then prevail, he addresses it thus,
these things saith he that is holy, he that is true; truth and
holiness go together; truth influences the heart, and that the
life and conversation.</p>
<p>There will be great peace and prosperity of all kinds, inward
and outward, spiritual and temporal; in these days of the
Messiah&rsquo;s spiritual reign, shall the righteous flourish;
and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth: as the
saints will enjoy great peace of conscience and tranquillity of
mind so they will have nothing to disturb them without; there
will be no more persecution; there will be none to hurt or
destroy in all the Lord&rsquo;s holy mountain, as there will be
no discord among themselves, so no distress from any enemies,
violence shall no more be heard in their land, nor wasting and
destruction within their border.&nbsp; O happy, halcyon
days!&nbsp; I go on to observe,</p>
<p>There will be a personal appearance <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>of the Son of God, and a glorious one
it will be: he will personally appear; the Lord himself shall
descend, not by his spirit, or by the communication of his grace,
or by his gracious presence, as before; but in person he will
descend from the third heaven, where he is, in our nature, into
the air, where he will be visible; every eye shall see him, when
he cometh with clouds, or in the clouds of heaven, which will be
his chariot; he will descend on earth et the proper time; and his
feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives; on that spot of ground
from whence he ascended to heaven.&nbsp; Job seems to have this
descent of his in view when he says, he shall stand at the latter
day upon the earth; which seems to respect not so much his first
coming as his second; since it is connected with the resurrection
of the dead.</p>
<p>This appearance of Christ will be a very glorious one: it is
called the <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Happy are those that belong to this city, who are
fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;
whose citizenship is in heaven, and they have a right to enter in
through the gates into the holy city, the new Jerusalem; but
miserable will these be that will be without, for without are
dogs: and then he that is unjust, will be unjust still; and he
that is filthy, will be filthy still; and he that is righteous,
will be righteous still; and he that is holy, will be holy
still.</p>

Extraordinary Prediction relating to the Downfall of the House of
Bourbon and the House of Austria</i>.</p>
<h2>RELATED BY MR. JOHN WESLEY.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">little</span> before the conclusion of
the late war in Flanders, one who came from thence gave us a very
strange relation; I knew not what judgment to form of this, but
waited till John Haim should come over, of whose veracity I could
no more doubt than of his understanding.&nbsp; The account he
gave was this; Jonathan Pyrah was a member of our society in
Flanders, I knew him some years, and knew him to be a man of an
unblameable character.&nbsp; One day he was summoned to appear
before the Board of General Officers; one of them said, What is
this we hear of you? we hear you have turned Prophet, and that
you foretell <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>the downfall of the bloody house of Bourbon, and the
haughty house of Austria; we should be glad if you were a real
Prophet, and if your prophecies came true; but what sign do you
give to convince us you are so, and that your predictions will
come to pass?&nbsp; He readily answered, Gentlemen, I give you a
sign: to-morrow, at twelve o&rsquo;clock, you shall have such a
storm of thunder and lightning as you never had before since you
came into Flanders.&nbsp; I give you a second sign: as little as
any of you except any such thing, as little appearance of it as
there is now, you shall have a general engagement with the French
within three days.&nbsp; I give you a third sign: I shall be
ordered to advance in the first line; if I am a false Prophet I
shall be shot dead at the first discharge, but if I am a true
Prophet I shall only receive a musket-ball in the calf of my left
leg.&nbsp; At twelve the <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>next day there was such thunder and
lightning as they never had in Flanders; on the third day,
contrary to all expectation, was the general battle of Fontenoy;
he was ordered to advance in the first line, and at the very
first discharge he did receive a musket-ball in the calf of his
left leg.</p>
<p>When the war was over he returned to England, but the story
was got here before him, in consequence of which he was sent for
by the countess of Stair, and several other persons of quality,
who were desirous of hearing so surprising an account from his
own mouth.&nbsp; He could not bear so much honour; it quite
turned his brain.&nbsp; In a little time he went stark mad, and
so he continues to this day, living still, as I apprehend, on
Wibsey Moor Side, within a few miles of Bradford.</p>
<p>So much for this military Prophet.&nbsp; Mr. Wesley remarks in
a note that he is since dead; but we are not able to <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>ascertain
whether there be any account of him and his predictions in the
papers or other periodical publications of that time.&nbsp; If
any gentleman is in possession of information on this subject,
the intelligence is worth communicating to the public.</p>
<p>Part of this prophecy being fulfilled, the objects in view to
be obtained by a publication are, what was the exact prophecy?
whether the several circumstances mentioned did take place.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">LIFE AND PROPHECIES</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
MOTHER SHIPTON.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the second year of the reign of
Henry VII., which was the year 1486, there lived a woman called
Agatha Shipton, at a place called Knaresborough, in
Yorkshire.&nbsp; She came of poor parentage, who died and left
her, at the age of fifteen, destitute.&nbsp; After their decease,
she still lived in the old <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>house; but being now deprived of
those helps she formerly enjoyed, she was obliged to seek relief
from the parish; which she did, but with so much regret and
grief, that she seemed in her begging rather to command alms,
than in a humble manner to desire it.</p>
<p>Satan looked on her poverty to be great, and knowing her evil
inclination (for you must understand that Satan is a good
scholar), and perceiving that she was willing to accept of any
proposition to change her condition, he, one time, as she was
sitting melancholy under a tree by a river side, accosted her in
the form of a very handsome young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pretty
maid,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why so sad? thy age is too tender
for thy head to be troubled with the cares of the world; come,
tell me what is the matter, and if it lie within <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>my power to
assist thee, as I am sure it doth, thou shalt not want a friend
of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Agatha cast up her eyes, and seeing a face so lovely, could
not suspect Satan hid in that comely shape, whereupon, in a
lamentable tone, she expressed all that troubled her, informing
him of her great wants, and that, not knowing how to work, she
could not provide what her necessities required.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pish,&rdquo; said Satan &ldquo;this is nothing; be ruled
by me, and all shall be well.&rdquo;&nbsp; She told him she
would.&nbsp; Hereupon, he ordered her to meet him at the same
place the next day, and he would bring some friends along with
him; for he told her he resolved to marry her.&nbsp; She promised
him she would; and accordingly they met.&nbsp; He came riding
upon a stately <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>horse, with a pillion behind him for his spouse,
attended by a great many gallants (as they appeared), well
mounted, and in a noble equipage.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s attendants soon conveyed his mistress behind
him; she not in the least doubting the reality of all she
saw.</p>
<p>They needed neither switch nor spur to hasten them forward,
the horses were fiery enough of themselves, and ran with that
swiftness, that the wind could not overtake them in their full
speed: soon they arrived at their journey&rsquo;s end, where
seemed to be a very stately house, with a pair of great gates,
which, at their approach, was opened by a porter in his livery
gown.&nbsp; Alighting, she went in, where she saw a great many
servants, who seemed, at the sight of her and their master, to
show much respect and obeisance.</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Now
did Satan command rich garments to be brought, which she was
immediately clothed with; and being thus richly attired, she was
ushered into a great hall, where was a long table, furnished with
all the varieties the whole world could afford; at the upper end
of which table she was placed, next to her intended husband: all
the rest of the guests placed themselves as they thought
fit.&nbsp; As they had the choicest cheer, so they had the best
of wines, and sweetest music.</p>
<p>Dinner being ended, they fell to dancing; and now Satan told
her he was no mortal, but spirit, immaterial, and not burdened by
a body, nor hindered by any material thing; &ldquo;So that I can,
when I please, pierce through the earth, and ransack its
treasures, and bring what precious thing I please from thence to
bestow on those that serve <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>me.&nbsp; I know all rare arts and
sciences, and can teach them to whom I please.&nbsp; I can
disturb the elements, stir up thunders and lightnings, destroy
the best of things which were created for the use of man, and can
appear in what shape or form I please.&nbsp; It will take too
long to describe my power, or tell you what I can do; but I will
only tell thee what thou shalt do.&nbsp; That being done, I will
give thee power to raise hail, tempests, with lightning and
thunder; the winds shall be at thy command, and shall bear thee
whither thou art willing to go, though ever so far off, and shall
bring thee back again when thou hast a mind to return.&nbsp; The
hidden treasures of the earth shall be at thy disposal and
pleasure, and nothing shall be wanting to complete thy happiness
here.&nbsp; Thou shalt, moreover, heal or kill whom thou
pleaseth; <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>destroy or preserve either man or beast; know what is
passed, and assuredly tell what is to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here
note, by the way, Satan is a liar from the beginning, and will
promise more by ten millions than he knows he is capable of
performing, to the intent that he may ensnare a soul.</p>
<p>This poor ignorant wretch easily believed what this grand
deceiver of mankind told her, and being ravished with the
thoughts of being so highly preferred, she condescended to all
Satan would have her do, whereupon he bid her say after him in
this manner: <i>Raziel ellimiham mir amwish ziragia
Psonthonphanchia Raphaelel have run a tapinot am becaz mitzphecat
jarid cuman hapheah Gabriel Heydon turris dungeonis
philonomostarkes sophecord hankim</i>.&nbsp; After she had
repeated these words after him, he bid her say after <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>him again:
<i>Kametzeatuph Odel Pheraz Tumbag in Gall Flemmugen Victow
Denmarkeonto</i>.&nbsp; Having finished his last wicked speech,
which even the chief of his minions understood not, and of which
none but Satan himself can pick out the meaning, it thundered so
horridly that every clap seemed as if the vaulted roof of heaven
had cracked, and was tumbling down on her head; and withal, that
stately palace, which she thought she was then in, vanished in a
thrice; so did her sumptuous apparel: and now her eyes being
opened, she found herself in a dark dolesome wood, a place,
which, from the creation, had scarce ever enjoyed the benefit of
one single sun-beam.&nbsp; Whilst she was thinking in what course
to steer, in order to return, two flaming fiery dragons appeared
before her, tied to a chariot, and as she was <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>consulting
with herself what was best to be done, she was insensibly hoisted
into it, and with speed unimaginable, conveyed through the air to
her own poor cottage.</p>
<p>Being come home, the neighbours flocked around her, having
missed her for two or three days, shrewdly suspecting some
mischief had befallen her; but when they beheld her face, they
were all amazed to see such a strange alteration in her
countenance in so short a time!&nbsp; Before she met Satan she
looked healthy, but now that red plumpness had vanished, there
was nothing to be seen but a pale shrivelled skin on her cheek,
which, for want of flesh seemed to fall into her mouth, to be
devoured by her hunger-starved jaws.&nbsp; Those about her, who
were charitable-minded, pitied her, <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>comforted, and gave her money,
which, with a great deal of disdain and scorn, she threw at them,
saying, she wanted not, nor stood in need of their alms,
&ldquo;for here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;is money enough,&rdquo;
plucking her hand out of her pocket; the people near her
discovered that what was in her hands was nothing else but some
aspen-leaves, and notwithstanding they endeavoured to persuade
her that she was mistaken in supposing that to be money, yet she
would not believe them, so strong a power had Satan gotten over
her already.</p>
<p>In fine, she bid them all begone, for now she began to take
little delight in human society; it was not long that they had
left her, before Satan came in to see her, in the same handsome
young form as he first appeared unto her, telling her that he
came to supply <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>the company of those she had wisely dismissed; that she
needed not the society of any human creature, for he would not
fail to be constantly with her: always bringing with him what
should not only serve for a bare livelihood, but be her delight,
pleasure, and satisfaction: hereupon, by Satan&rsquo;s command,
there instantly seemingly appeared a complete noise of music,
with a great variety of dishes of meat of the choicest and most
pleasing sort, which so ravished Agatha that she fell to the
ground in a profound and deep trance.&nbsp; One of the neighbours
coming in at this time, wondered to see Agatha lying on the floor
motionless; however, out of pity, she endeavoured to awaken
Agatha; but using what means she could, it all signified nothing;
she shook and pinched her, yet still <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>she lay insensible.&nbsp; This woman
being strangely amazed, ran out among the rest of the neighbours,
crying out poor Agatha Shipton was suddenly struck dead, and
desired them to go into the house with her, and be eye-witnesses
of the truth; whereupon several went, and found what this woman
said to be seemingly true; but one wiser than the rest, stooped
down, and perceiving that she breathed, said, &ldquo;Friends, ye
are all mistaken; Agatha is not dead, but in a trance, or else
she is bewitched.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had scarcely uttered these
words before Agatha began to stir, and soon after, raising
herself on her legs, cried out in a very distracted tone,
&ldquo;What do you here, vile wretches!&nbsp; Cannot I enjoy my
pleasures, but ye must be eaves-dropping?&nbsp; Get ye gone, ye
have nothing to do here;&rdquo; and hereupon she <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>fell a
dancing; which they wondered at because they could hear no
music.&nbsp; At length, Agatha turned about, and seeing they were
not gone, said, &ldquo;If you are resolved thus to disturb me,
and will not go, I will make ye.&rdquo;&nbsp; This somewhat
affrighted them, for they now verily believed she was a witch,
and as they were hastening away, with all imaginable speed, a
sudden strong wind hoisted them to a great height into the air,
falling all to the ground again without the least harm, the men
were like overgrown goats, with large horns on their heads, and
the women riding on their backs, which sight, as they produced
inexpressible wonder, so amidst their amazement they could not
but burst out into excessive laughter.</p>
<p>This wonderful and unexpected <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>exploit was instantly noised all
about the country, and occasioned a great resort of people to the
place where Agatha lived; which so perplexed her by their
undesired visits, that she resolved within herself to be revenged
on some of them; which by Satan&rsquo;s help she effected: one
had a horse that died suddenly, and being opened, there was found
in his stomach fish-hooks and hair, instead of hay and oats;
another going to sit down at table with persons of good quality,
at dinner-time, and thinking himself very spruce and fine, had in
an instant his ruff pulled off his neck, and the seat of a house
of office clapped on in its place: he that sat next to him
breaking out in a great laughter at the sight thereof, was served
a little better, for his hat was invisibly conveyed away, and the
kitchen <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>pan put on instead thereof; a modest young gentlewoman,
who did sit at the table at that time, and was come on no other
errand but to see this young witch, which was so much talked of,
looking on these two worthy spectacles of laughter, endeavouring
all she could to refrain from laughing, but could not for above a
quarter of an hour: this made them all laugh so extremely, that
the master of the house was alarmed, and being desirous to share
with his guests in their mirth, came running upstairs as fast as
his legs could carry him; when about to enter the door, he could
not, and no wonder, since the oldest man living never saw a
larger pair of horns than he had on his head.</p>
<p>Whilst they were gazing one on another, more than half
distracted, they were reduced to the same condition <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>they were
in before; after which there followed a noise, as if a hundred
persons were laughing together, but nothing at all was seen.</p>
<p>These persons fearing something worse might befall them if
they stayed any longer, made all the haste they could to be
gone.&nbsp; Agatha knowing their intent, resolved to take her
farewell of them by serving them one trick more, which was this:
As they were about to mount on horseback, they were pelted with
rotten apples and filth.&nbsp; As they rode through the town,
such as thought they rode singly, were all observed to have
behind them, each man, a deformed old woman; and as their faces
differed all one from another, so did their habits, which were
all tattered and ragged, and patched with a hundred
colours.&nbsp; Fear, shame, <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>and the hooting of the people, made
them put spurs to their horses, neither did they forbear the
whip, nor anything that might add speed to their horses&rsquo;
heels, so that it may be said, they rather flew than rode.</p>
<p>Coming home, they declared what wonderful things they had seen
performed, though by a young one, yet as they believed, the
greatest witch in the world.&nbsp; This news being so generally
spread, came at length to the ears of the justices, who now
thought it high time to question and bring to examination a
person that was so much talked of, and might, if let alone, do a
great deal of mischief.&nbsp; Accordingly two stout fellows were
despatched for her; they soon found her, and nothing daunted by
her witcheries, they resolutely carried her before the justice,
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>where
being brought, she, not a jot daunted, told him that she had more
authority than he, and that notwithstanding his power, she could
command one that could overrule him; that she was a princess, and
could have at her back a thousand spirits of the air, and as many
of the earth and water; that she could raise a tempest presently
that should overturn his house about his ears, &ldquo;and that
you may know it lies not in your power to detain me, three words
will procure my liberty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hereupon, she said,
&ldquo;Updraxi, call Stygician Helluox!&rdquo;&nbsp; She had
scarce uttered the last word, before there came in a horrid
winged dragon, which immediately took her up, and carried her
away from the amazed justice and the attendants about him, half
dead with fear.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>This
so affrighted all that heard of it, that none would undertake to
meddle with her more, so that she had a considerable time of
respite.&nbsp; But she now began to be more admired than before,
being discovered to be enceinte.&nbsp; The people could not tell
what to think, or who could be the father.&nbsp; While people
were generally passing their verdict on Agatha, she was once
taken and brought before a justice, and amongst other questions,
was asked, whether she was enceinte?&nbsp; She acknowledged it;
nay, further, that the father was no mortal wight.&nbsp; The
justice gave no credit to what she said, as looking on her as an
ignorant seduced woman; and so asked her what bail she could
produce, intending to defer the business until she was
delivered.&nbsp; In this very nick of time, two <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>gentlemen,
as they appeared by their habits, voluntarily proffered
themselves, but as soon as accepted for bail, vanished; however,
Agatha had permission to go home.</p>
<p>In course of time was born, Mother Shipton, which proved the
conclusion of her miserable life.&nbsp; But her entry into the
world was such a terror to all that beheld her, that several
credible person then presented, have several times confessed that
they have never beheld the like: such strange and horrible
noises, that the persons about her could scarcely find so much
courage in themselves as to continue in the place where she was;
much less when they beheld the strange and unparalleled
physiognomy of the child, which was so misshapen, that it is
altogether impossible to express it <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>fully in words, or the most
ingenious to describe her in colours, though many persons of
eminent qualifications in that art have often attempted it, but
without success; therefore, according to the best observations of
her, take this true, though not full, account of her features and
body.&nbsp; She was of an indifferent height, but very morose and
big-boned; her head very long, with very great goggling, but
sharp and fiery eyes; her nose of an incredible and
unproportionable length, having in it many crooks and turnings,
adorned with many strange pimples of divers colours, as red and
blue mixed, which, like vapours of brimstone, gave such a lustre
to the affrighted spectators in the dead time of the night, that
one of them confessed several times, that her nurse needed no
other light to assist her in the <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>performance of her duty: her cheeks
were of a black swarthy complexion, much like a mixture of the
black yellow jaundice, wrinkled, shrivelled and very hollow;
insomuch that as the ribs of her body, so the impression of her
teeth was easily to be discerned though both sides of her face,
answering one side to the other, like the notches in a valley,
excepting only two of them, which stood quite out of her mouth,
in imitation of the tusks of a wild boar, or tooth of an
elephant, a thing so strange in an infant, that no age can
parallel: her chin was of the same complexion as her face,
turning up her mouth; and shrieks being heard from an unknown
cause, as if there had been more than an ordinary correspondence
between her teeth and it.&nbsp; Her neck was so strangely
distorted, that her right shoulder was <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>forced to
be a supporter to her hood, it being propped up by her chin, so
that the right side of her body stood lower than her left, like
the reeling of a ship that sails with a side wind; again, her
left side was quite turned the contrary way, as if her body had
been screwed together piece after piece, and not rightly placed;
her left shoulder hanging just perpendicular to the bottom of the
back.&nbsp; Her legs were very crooked and misshapen; the toes of
her feet looking towards her left side, so that it was very hard
for any person (could she have stood up) to guess which road she
intended to steer her course, because she never could look that
way she resolved to go.</p>
<p>After she had remained under the care of the nurse for a space
of a month or thereabouts, she was put out to nurse <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>at the
charge of the parish to a poor woman hard by in the town, where
she continued for the space of half a year or thereabouts, the
house not being in any way disturbed at all, till at last her
nurse having been abroad with the chief of the parishioners,
either to procure something of their charity for her subsistence
and the maintenance of her family, or else to fetch her money
from the overseers of the poor for nursing the child; and
returning home to her house she found her door wide open, at
which she, much amazed and affrighted, ran to her next neighbour
and acquainted her she was quite undone, for her house was broken
open and robbed.&nbsp; The man immediately rose from his dinner,
accompanied by his wife and also a labouring man.&nbsp;
Approaching the door, they endeavoured <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>to enter,
but before they could all get in a very strange noise was heard
in the next room to them, as if it had been a concert of cats,
which so affrighted them that they all ran towards the door,
endeavouring to get out again, but in vain; for at their approach
there were great long yokes put about their necks, in the form of
a cross or turnstile, so that they could not possibly return; and
while they were thus striving and crying out for help, their
yokes at last fell off, and a staff was laid upon the men&rsquo;s
shoulders, upon which an old woman presented herself, sometimes
hanging by the heels and sometimes by the toes.&nbsp; These
sports continued for the space of half an hour, so that the poor
men were never more tired nor less pleased at anything than in
being constrained to humour this piece of activity.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>After
they had got a discharge from this their new employment, the
house being now quiet, and they had a little recovered their
senses, missing the woman they ran further into the house, where
they found them in a room in which stood a pair of yarwingles
made in the form of a cross.&nbsp; The two women were forced to
take the four ends thereof in their hands, and so danced round
about one after the other until they were almost tired to death,
carrying upon their shoulders an imp in the likeness of a monkey
or ape, which hung close upon them; and whenever they slacked
their pace, these spirits pricked them forward, continuing this
for a considerable time, till at length they vanished quite out
of sight, leaving these poor wretches no less weary than
astonished, and who, perceiving <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>themselves at liberty, ran to
several of the neighbours, acquainting them with what had
happened, and causing great amazement amongst them; and
immediately the whole town was in an uproar.&nbsp; The minister
and several of the most eminent of the inhabitants consulted
together upon the occasion what to do in the business; some of
them threatening the informers, others thinking they were
distracted, but at last they resolved to go to the house; yet
when they came near there arose a dispute who should first enter,
which at last was agreed upon; and the parson, with his
congregation attending him in the rear, entered the door
quivering and shaking, whereupon there was suddenly a noise like
the treading of people on stones, though the house had no other
but an earthen floor; and <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>very sweet musical harmony of
several notes was heard, and all presently vanished again.&nbsp;
The minister and inhabitants entered, and searching the house,
missed the child; one of them looking up the chimney, saw the
cradle wonderfully hanging up, three yards high, without any
support; this was as strangely conveyed down again.&nbsp; They
encouraged the nurse, left her in the house (though affrighted),
and departed.</p>
<p>Mother Shipton&rsquo;s nurse was, after this, sometimes in
great perplexity, not knowing what was become of her for days
together; but when she was in her greatest scare after her, she
saw her oftentimes drop suddenly through the roof of the
house.&nbsp; Going out, upon her return she many times found her
child stretched out to a prodigious <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>length, taller than the tallest
living, and at other times as much shortened.&nbsp; The poor
woman&rsquo;s work for the major part, was only to rectify what
these spirits disordered about her house.&nbsp; The chairs and
stools would frequently march up stairs and down, and they
usually played at bowls with the trenches and dishes: sometimes
at dinner the meat would be removed before she could touch a bit;
which things, as they much troubled the nurse, so they gave great
satisfaction to Mother Shipton, as it appeared by her monstrous
smiles.&nbsp; Now and then, to pacify her nurse, when she saw her
much vexed, she would say, &ldquo;Be contented; there is nothing
here that will harm you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be short, the nurse was so continually terrified by these
apparitions, that she resolved to complain to the <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>parish;
and, having made known the truth of what had passed, in
commiseration to the almost distracted woman, they removed Mother
Shipton to another place, where she was put to school, being of
an age fit for it.</p>
<p>By this time Mother Shipton was grown a lusty girl, and as she
was left to the care of the parish, so the parish took care that
she should have the common sort of learning, that is to say,
reading and writing, bestowed upon her.&nbsp; Coming to school
her mistress began to instruct her as other children, beginning
with three or four letters at first; but to the amazement and
astonishment of her mistress, she exactly pronounced every letter
in the alphabet without teaching; her mistress then showed her a
primer, which she read at first sight as well as any in the <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>school, and
so on with every book that was shown her.</p>
<p>As this produced wonder in her schoolmistress, so it caused
hatred and envy in her comrades; some flouted her for her
monstrous long nose, others endeavoured to beat her, and all
strove to harm her; but she valued them not, revenging herself on
every one of them that intended her harm.&nbsp; Some were
pinched, and yet no hand seen that did it; others struck
speechless when they were about to say their lessons, not being
able to utter a word; none escaped from being served one scurvy
trick or other.&nbsp; This so enraged the parents of these
children, looking on Mother Shipton as the sole cause thereof,
that she was discharged from the school, and so left to the wide
world.&nbsp; The singularities of Mother Shipton now began to <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>be talked
of everywhere; she was often seen, when alone, to laugh heartily;
at other times to talk to herself; uttering very strange riddles,
which occasioned some of the more sober sort to converse with
her, receiving such strange things from her, as required a long
study to find out the meaning.</p>
<p>Never a day passed, wherein she related not something very
remarkable, and that required the most serious
consideration.&nbsp; And now it was that people flocked far and
near (her fame was so great), to be resolved of their doubts, all
returning wonderfully satisfied in the explanations she gave to
their questions.</p>
<p>And now Mother Shipton, beginning to grow famous in the world
for her notable judgment in things to come, there resorted to her
house a number <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>of people of all sorts, both old and young, rich and
poor, especially young maidens, who have always a great desire to
know when they shall be married, as also, what manner of husbands
they shall have, to which she gave such satisfactory answers,
both for the person and time, that no sooner could a young maid
get into her teens, but she would presently trot to Mother
Shipton&rsquo;s, to be resolved of her doubt.&nbsp; Now though
she was not mercenary herself, but refused great gifts when
proffered unto her; yet did she keep a young wench, who, rather
than fail, if they forgot to open their purse to her, would
remember to open her mouth to them, and tell them, that neither
Dame Shipton nor she could be maintained with thanks, but that
the belly required meat to feed it; and that it was money <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>that made
the mare to go.&nbsp; One day, there came a certain young heir
thither, whose father was sick, to be resolved by her whether he
should live or die; but Mother Shipton could by no means be
wrought upon to tell him anything; whereupon he proffered the
maid great store of money, if she could by any means persuade the
dame to fulfil his request; the wench, greedy of money, promised
him fair; that if he would come the next morning, he would be
certain to be resolved; in the meantime, she importuned her dame
with the most cunning rhetoric that she could invent; but she was
deaf to all entreaties, and would by no means be induced thereto,
whereupon the wench resolved with herself, rather than lose the
money, to give him an answer of her own invention; when the next
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>morning
came she performed her part in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The grave provided hath a room:<br />
Prepare for death, thy hour is come.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The young gentleman having received this answer, went away
very joyful, hoping presently to reap the golden crop which his
father had sown, and to be in an instant possessor of all his
vast estate; but the sequel proved quite contrary; for by the
time he came home, great hopes of amendment appeared in his
father, who each day grew better and better, so that in a short
time he became perfectly well.&nbsp; This unexpected recovery of
the old man struck such a damp into the young heir, that he
presently took to his bed, fell extremely ill, and in a short
time grew so much <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>worse that all the symptoms of a dying man appeared in
him; the old man having no more children, was very desirous of
his life; and to know whether he should recover, he sent to
Mother Shipton, who, knowing by her art what her maid had done,
severely chid her for the same, threatening to turn her out of
her service.&nbsp; In the meantime the messenger was come to her
house, who having delivered his errand returned back with this
answer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For other&rsquo;s death who do gape out,<br
/>
Their own, unlook&rsquo;d for, comes about.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old man having received this answer, was much troubled,
thinking his own death predicted thereby, not imagining what his
son had done: but he was soon quieted of that suspicion, <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>for within
two days the young man died; when a servant (who knew the
circumstance) informed him of the truth of the whole matter.</p>
<p>At divers other times, when persons of quality came to visit
her, she delivered the following prophecies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the Ouse Bridge and Trinity Church meets, they
shall build it in the day and it shall fall in the night, until
they get the highest stone of Trinity Church the lowest stone of
Ouse Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This came to pass; for Trinity steeple in York was blown down
with a tempest, and Ouse Bridge broken down with a flood, and
what they did in the day time in repairing the bridge fell down
in the night, till at last they laid the highest stone of the
steeple for the foundation of the Bridge.</p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>&ldquo;A time shall happen when a ship shall come
sailing up the Thames, till it comes against London, and the
master of the ship will ask the captain why he weeps, since he
has made so good a voyage.&nbsp; And he will say, and what a good
city this was, none in the world comparable to it, and now
there&rsquo;s scarce a house left, that can let us drink for our
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were sadly verified after the dreadful fire
of London in 1666, when there was not a house left along the
Thames side from the Tower to the Temple.</p>
<p>About this time, some differences arising betwixt King Henry
VIII. and the French king, great preparations for war were made
in England, the drums beating in every county to summon voluntary
valour to express itself in <a name="page141"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 141</span>defence of their king and
country.&nbsp; Many heroic spirits who made honour their aim, not
dreading dangers, now came forward, and indeed, so many appeared
under Mars&rsquo; banner, that he who was furnished with limbs
and an estate, and declined the service, was called a
coward.&nbsp; There was then living in the North a young heir,
who was newly come to his estate; one whose tongue was all fire,
and his heart all ice; who would kill thousands by his words, but
durst not venture to do anything in deeds; this gallant being by
some of his equals pricked on to make his appearance in the field
of Mars, and not to lie sleeping at home, when fame summoned him
forth to action, knew not what to do in this case; loath was he
to lose his loved life; and yet the aspersion of a coward, even
to a coward <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>himself, is of all things most odious; he therefore
promised that none should be more willing than he to spend his
blood in the quarrel of that country from whence he received his
dear life; but yet he resolved within himself not to set one step
forward in that path of danger till he had first consulted with
Mother Shipton, concerning what success he should have in his
journey; if it was bad, he resolved by a feigned sickness to
evade it; thinking it no good policy for a man to part with that
life in an instant, which with great cost and care had been many
years in bringing up.</p>
<p>Hereupon he hastened to our Northern Prophetess, acquainted
her with his condition, and very earnestly desired of her (as she
to whom nothing was hid) that she would unfold to him whether <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>good or bad
fortune should be his attendant in this his expedition.&nbsp;
Mother Shipton, though she perceived his sheepish courage to be
very unanswerable to that of a soldier, yet foreknowing what
would come to pass, returned him the following answer: which
without more ado, fully satisfied him to proceed, and performed
what he had promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the English Lion shall set his paw on the Gallic
shore, then shall the Lilies begin to drop for fear.&nbsp; There
shall be much weeping and wailing amongst the ladies of that
country: because the princely Eagle shall join with the Lion, to
tread down all that shall oppose them; and though many
sagittaries shall appear in defence of the Lilies, yet shall they
not prevail; because the dull animal of the North shall <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>be put to
confusion; and though it be his will, yet shall cause great shame
unto them.&nbsp; Now shall the mitred Peacock first begin to
plume, whose train shall make a great show in the world for a
time, but shall afterwards vanish away, and his honour come to
nothing; which shall take its end at Kingston.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Explanation.</h3>
<p>By the &ldquo;English Lion&rdquo; was meant the King of
England; and by setting his &ldquo;paw on the Gallic
shore,&rdquo; the landing of his army in France; by the
&ldquo;Lily beginning to drop for fear,&rdquo; was signified the
great trouble and perplexity of the French, the Lilies being the
arms of France; the &ldquo;weeping and wailing amongst the ladies
of that <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>country,&rdquo; denotes the miseries and destruction
incident to war; by the &ldquo;princely Eagle joining with the
Lion, and treading down all that shall oppose them,&rdquo; is
meant the German Emperor (whose arms were the Eagle) who joined
in amity with King Henry, and served him in his wars; by the
&ldquo;sagittaries that appeared in defence of the Lilies,&rdquo;
were meant the French cavalry, the chief strength of France,
consisting of horsemen, who appeared like sagittaries, that is to
say, half men and half horses; and whereas it was said,
&ldquo;yet they should not prevail,&rdquo; it fell out so
accordingly; for notwithstanding all the opposition of the French
armies, King Henry proceeded on vigorously, conquering and taking
several towns of importance.&nbsp; But to come to that which most
nearly concerns the <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>matter, viz., the success of our
young heir in his expedition, which was hinted forth unto him in
these words: &ldquo;Because the dull animal of the North shall
put them to confusion, and though it be against his will, yet
shall cause great shame unto them;&rdquo; by the dull animal of
the North was meant this fresh-water soldier, who, according to
the Prophecy, put the Frenchmen to confusion and great shame; for
passing the seas with King Henry, being mounted on a stately
horse, as both armies confronted each other, he being at the head
of the battle, just before the charge, somebody striking his
horse, he carried him upon the enemy with such violence, as put
their front in some disorder, which being perceived by our men,
they presently so seconded him that the French ran away, leaving
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>the
English a glorious victory, purchased with little cost.</p>
<p>By this means was Mother Shipton&rsquo;s predictions
fulfilled, to the disgrace of the French, and great praise to the
young gallant; for the rest of the Prophecy the interpretation
runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;mitred Peacock,&rdquo; was intended Cardinal
Wolsey, signified by that bird, because of his great pride, who,
being but a poor butcher&rsquo;s son of Ipswich, in Suffolk, grew
to such a height, that he thought himself superior to the chief
nobles of the land, living in such splendour as not to be
paralleled; according to the new Prophecy, &ldquo;whose train
shall make a great show in the world;&rdquo; and whereas it is
said, &ldquo;the peacock should then begin to plume,&rdquo; so it
was, that when King Henry had taken the city of Tournay, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>in France,
he made Wolsey bishop thereof, who soon after rose to the highest
degree of honour a subject could be capable of, which afterwards
(as the Prophecy says) &ldquo;vanished away, and his great honour
came to nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; And lastly, whereas it said, he
should &ldquo;have his end at Kingston.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cardinal
being told of this prophecy, would never pass through the town of
Kingston, though lying directly in the road from his own house to
the court; but afterwards being arrested for high treason, by the
Earl of Northumberland, and Sir Anthony Kingston, the Lieutenant
of the Tower, sent unto him, his very name (remembering the
prophecy) struck such a terror to his heart that he soon after
expired.</p>
<p>Mother Shipton had now got a name far and near for a cunning
woman, or <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>a woman of foresight, that her words were counted
oracles, nor was she visited only by private persons, but advised
with by people of the greatest quality.&nbsp; Among which number
at that time was Cardinal Wolsey; when it was reported that he
intended to live at York, she publicly said, &ldquo;He should
never come thither,&rdquo; which, coming to his ears, and being
offended, he caused three lords to go to her, who came disguised
to Dringhouses, near York, where leaving their men, they took a
guide to Mother Shipton&rsquo;s, and knocking at the door, she
called from within, &ldquo;Come in, Mr. Besley (the guide), and
these noble lords with you,&rdquo; which surprised them, that she
should know them; for when they came in she called each of them
by their names, and treated them with ale and cakes; <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>whereupon,
said one of the lords, &ldquo;If you knew our errand you would
not make so much of us; you said the cardinal should never see
York.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I said he
might see York but never come at it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the lords, &ldquo;when he does come thou
shalt be burnt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, taking off her linen
handkerchief from her head, she said, &ldquo;If this
burns,&rdquo; and immediately flung it into the fire, but it did
not burn; and after it had laid in the flames a quarter of an
hour, she took it out again not so much as singed.&nbsp; One of
the lords then asked her what she thought of him.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
lord, the time will come when your lordship will be as low as I
am, and that is low indeed,&rdquo; which proved true, for shortly
after he was beheaded.</p>
<p>Nor was her speech of the cardinal less verified; for coming
to Cawood, he <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>went to the top of the tower and asked where York was,
which being shown him, he inquired how far it was thither.&nbsp;
For, quoth he, &ldquo;There was a witch said I should never see
York.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said one present,
&ldquo;your eminence is misinformed; she said, you might see it,
but never come at it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he vowed to burn her when
he came there, which was but eight miles distant; but, behold, he
was immediately sent for back by the king, and never
returned.</p>
<p>Mother Shipton&rsquo;s prediction coming thus effectually to
pass, spread her fame far wider than it was; insomuch that many
who before looked upon her as a crack-brained woman, now began to
admire her, and to esteem her words as oracles.&nbsp; And as the
nature of English people is rather to desire to know what is to
come, than to seek to rectify <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>aught that is done amiss, so the
greatest part of her visitants came only to be acquainted with
what she knew would come to pass; of which number was the Abbot
of Beverley, who fearing the downfall of religious houses, and a
change of the religion then professed, putting on counterfeit
clothes, came to Mother Shipton&rsquo;s, and knocking at the
door, she being within, called to him, and said: &ldquo;Come in,
Mr. Abbot, for you are not so much disguised but the fox may be
seen through the sheep&rsquo;s skin.&nbsp; Come take a stool and
sit down, for you shall not go away unsatisfied of what you
desire,&rdquo; and thereupon she began to utter forth her
Prophecies in this sort:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When the cow doth wive the bull,<br />
Then, oh! priest, beware thy skull!<br />
And when the lower shrubs do fall,<br />
The great trees quickly follow shall.<br />
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>The
mitred Peacock&rsquo;s lofty pride<br />
Shall to his master be a guide.<br />
And one great court to pass shall bring<br />
What was ne&rsquo;er done by any king.<br />
The poor shall grieve to see that day,<br />
And who did feast, must fast and pray.<br />
Fate so decreed their overthrow,<br />
Riches brought pride, and pride brought woe.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These prophecies were thus explained: by the
&ldquo;Cow,&rdquo; was made King Henry, by reason of the Earldom
of Richmond, which was his inheritance; and the
&ldquo;Bull,&rdquo; betokened Anne Boleyn, whom the king took to
wife in the room of Queen Catherine; her father gave the black
bull&rsquo;s head in his cognizance; and when the king had
married Queen Anne, then was fulfilled the second line of the
prophecy, viz., &ldquo;Then, oh! priest, beware thy skull!&rdquo;
for what a number of priests, religious and secular, lost their
heads, for <a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>offending against the laws, made to bring this matter
to pass.</p>
<p>Cardinal Wolsey (who was intended by the &ldquo;mitred
Peacock&rdquo;), in the height of his pride and vastness of his
undertakings, intending to erect two colleges, one at Ipswich,
where he was born, the other at Oxford, where he was bred; and
finding himself unable to endow them at his own charge, he
obtained licence of Pope Clement VII. to suppress forty small
monasteries in England, and to lay their old lands to his new
foundations, which was done accordingly, and the poor people that
lived in them were turned out of doors.&nbsp; Many of the clergy
were very much against this action of Wolsey, especially John
Fisher, Bishop of Rochester, alleging for the same an apologue of
&AElig;sop, that &ldquo;the iron head of the axe <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>craved a
handle of the wood of oaks, only to cut off the boughs of the
trees: but when it was a complete axe it felled all the
wood;&rdquo; applying it, that the suppressing of those smaller
houses would prove destructive to all the rest, which came to
pass accordingly; for King Henry, seeing the cardinal&rsquo;s
power to extend so far as to suppress these lower shrubs, he
thought his prerogative might stretch so far as to fell down the
great trees; and soon after dissolved the priory of Christ
Church, near Aldgate, in London (now known by the name of
Duke&rsquo;s Place), the richest in lands and ornaments of the
priories in London or Middlesex; which was a forerunner of the
dissolution of the rest; and that not long after came to
pass.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;Great Court,&rdquo; is meant the <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>Parliament,
the supremest court of England; which, in the twenty-seventh year
of King Henry&rsquo;s reign, to support the king&rsquo;s states,
and supply his wants, conferred on the crown all religious houses
which were not able clearly to expend above two hundred pounds a
year; the great ones not long after following the same fortune of
the smaller, which was not done (though attempted) by any king
before.</p>
<p>By the dissolution of these houses, many thousands were driven
to seek their fortunes in the wide world, and became utterly
exposed to want; when monkish profession was without possession,
many a young man proved an old beggar, and many forced to fast
for want of victuals, who formerly had it provided for them to
their hands.</p>
<p>The great riches and pride of the <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>monks and friars, was, no doubt, the
main cause of their overthrow; for whatsoever was the pretence,
questionless profit was the rope which pulled these religious
houses down.</p>
<p>All those things coming to pass before the abbot died, caused
him to have a great esteem of Mother Shipton, and to value her
prophecies more than ordinary conjectures; though at first he
could not tell what to make of her ambiguous lines, which, like
the oracles delivered at Delphos, rather brought one into a
labyrinth of confused conjectures than satisfied the expectation,
until by the clue of time, the riddles were manifest; and that
which at first seemed so hard, now appeared to the understanding
as easy; however, he at present kindly thanked Mother Shipton,
and liberally rewarded her maid, <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>much admiring that she could be so
clear-sighted as to see through his counterfeit dress; resolving
afterwards to be more informed by her concerning future events,
he at that time took his solemn leave of her, and returned
home.</p>
<p>Not long had the abbot been at home, but his abbey was visited
by some instrument employed by the Lord Cromwell for that
purpose.&nbsp; He who knew what was intended by this compliment
thought it not safe to strive against the stream, and therefore
quietly surrendered his monastery into the king&rsquo;s
hands.&nbsp; And now perceiving Mother Shipton&rsquo;s prophecies
plainly fulfilled in the downfall of those houses, which were
judged to be impregnable against all the assaults of malice and
time, considering the strange <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>revolution of so short a space, he
was very desirous to be more fully informed of the future.&nbsp;
In this resolution he repairs again to Mother Shipton, whom he
now accosts more familiarly than he did before, making himself
plainly known unto her; telling her that as what she had formerly
spoken he had found to be true in the event, so his judgment
persuaded him she was not ignorant of those things which were in
the future to ensue; and therefore desired she would not be nice
in imparting her foreknowledge to him; for which great favour,
though it were more than his deserts could command, yet should
there never in him be wanting a grateful tongue to acknowledge,
and a grateful heart to be thankful unto her, for so great a
favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Abbot,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;leave off <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>complimenting, as it is more fit for courtiers and
lovers, and not agreeable to an old woman, who will neither
flatter nor be flattered by any; and for what you came about, I
shall not be squeamish to fulfil your request; let me therefore
desire you to lend me your attention;&rdquo; and thereupon, after
some short pause, she thus began&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A prince that never shall be born,<br />
Shall make the shaved heads forlorn,<br />
Then shall commons rise in arms,<br />
And woman&rsquo;s malice cause much harms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These lines being prophecies of the actions in King
Edward&rsquo;s reign, for the reader&rsquo;s benefit we will
unfold the meaning of them by themselves, that we may not too
much burden his memory; but by variety add a pleasure to the
reading of them.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;Prince that never shall be <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>born,&rdquo; is meant King Edward VI., of whom all
reports agree that he was not naturally delivered into the world,
but that his mother&rsquo;s body was opened for his birth, that
she died of the operation the fourth day following: and by
&ldquo;shaved heads,&rdquo; is understood the monks, friars,
etc., who are said to become &ldquo;forlorn;&rdquo; the
Reformation beginning with the commencement of King
Edward&rsquo;s reign.</p>
<p>King Edward set out certain injunctions for the reformation of
religion; as the commissioners passed to divers places for the
establishing of them, much scorn was passed upon them, and the
farther they went from London, as the people were more uncivil,
so did they the more rise into insolence and contempt; for in
Cornwall, the commons flocked together, having killed <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>one of the
commissioners, and although justice was done upon the offenders
(the principal of them being executed in several places), yet
could not their boldness be beaten down by that severity, but
that the mischief spread farther.&nbsp; In Wiltshire and
Somersetshire, where the people, supposing that a Commonwealth
could not stand without commons, beat down enclosures, and laid
parks and fields bare.&nbsp; The like commotions followed in
Suffolk, Hampshire, Kent, Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, and
Rutlandshire, but the greatest of all was in Devonshire, and
Norfolk.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A virtuous lady then shall die,<br />
For being raised up too high;<br />
Her death shall cause another&rsquo;s joy,<br />
Who shall the kingdom much annoy.<br />
Mitres shall rise, mitres come down,<br />
And streams of blood shall Smithfield drown.<br />
<a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>England
shall join in league with Spain,<br />
Which some to hinder strive in vain,<br />
The Lioness from life retires,<br />
And pontifical priest expires.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lady Jane Gray, assuming the title of Queen upon her, for
her offence lost her head.&nbsp; This Lady Jane was a woman of
most rare and incomparable perfections; for besides her excellent
beauty, she was the mirror of her time for religion and
education, in the knowledge of the liberal sciences and skill in
languages; and far exceeded all of her sex and years.</p>
<p>The death of the Lady Jane was supposed to be a rejoicing to
Queen Mary, and who, by restoring Popery, and the persecutions
that the professors of the Gospel suffered in her time, is said
to bring the kingdom to much annoy.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;Mitres,&rdquo; are meant the <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>bishops,
who in the change of religion found great change; very few
keeping their seats wherein they had been seated by King Edward
VI.</p>
<p>Great was the number of martyrs burned in Smithfield in this
queen&rsquo;s reign, under the bloody hands of Bonner, Bishop of
London, and Dr. Story, Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s; the first
persecuting by wholesale, the second by retail; the names of all
those who in this place thus testified their faith by the loss of
their lives, would be too long here to recite; the chief of them
were Mr. John Rogers, Mr. John Bradford, Mr. Robert Glover,
etc.</p>
<p>Queen Mary intended to match herself with Philip, King of
Spain; the news thereof of being spread amongst the people, was
by them ill-resented, as dreading to be under the yoke of a <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>stranger;
but all to no purpose, for soon afterwards they were married, to
the mortification of the English.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;Lioness&rdquo; is meant Queen Mary, who having
reigned five years and some odd months, died of a dropsy.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;pontifical priest&rdquo; signifies Cardinal Pole,
who expired within a few hours after the death of Queen
Mary.&nbsp; This prelate was of princely extraction, his mother,
Margret, being daughter to George Duke of Clarence; when he was
young, he was brought up together with Queen Mary, and being a
zealous Catholic, during King Edward&rsquo;s reign, suffered a
voluntary exile for the same; when the marriage between Prince
Philip and Queen Mary was made up, he returned into England, and
was made Archbishop of Canterbury, but was more moderate than <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>some of his
fellow bishops, having a favourable inclination towards the
Protestants.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Lion fierce being dead and gone,<br />
A maiden Queen shall reign anon.<br />
The Papal power shall bear no sway,<br />
Rome&rsquo;s creed shall hence be swept away.<br />
The western monarch&rsquo;s wooden horses<br />
Shall be destroyed by the Drake&rsquo;s forces.<br />
More wonders yet! a widowed Queen<br />
In England shall be headless seen.<br />
The Harp shall give a better sound.<br />
An Earl without a head be found.<br />
Soon after shall the English Rose<br />
Unto a male her place dispose.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These lines being a prophecy of the most remarkable actions
during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, are to be interpreted after
this manner:</p>
<p>Queen Mary is here meant, not so much for the cruelty done by
her, as by the bishops and priests under her; in respect to the
blood that was shed, and <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>the persecutions then suffered, she
is here termed a fierce &ldquo;Lion;&rdquo; after whom is said,
&ldquo;A maiden Queen to reign anon,&rdquo; meant by Queen
Elizabeth, one who was the mirror of her age and sex, who for
above forty years managed the affairs of this kingdom; having,
when she began, few friends that durst help, and leaving no foes
when she died that could hurt her; acting her part so well whilst
here she reigned, that history can scarce afford us one prince to
be matched to her fame in all considerable particulars.</p>
<p>Soon after the queen coming to the crown, a Parliament began
at Westminster, wherein the laws of King Henry VIII. against the
see of &ldquo;Rome&rdquo; were renewed, and those of King Edward
VI. in favour of the Protestants revived, and the laws by Queen
Mary made against them, repealed.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>Uniformity of prayer and administration of sacrament
were enacted, and the queen acknowledged to be the only and
supreme governor of her kingdom.&nbsp; The people in each place
beating down superstitious pictures and images, which misguided
zeal had set up.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;western monarch&rsquo;s wooden horses,&rdquo; is
meant the King of Spain&rsquo;s great Armada, by them termed
invincible, though the success of it answered not the name; being
by Sir Francis Drake and others fought with and really
vanquished; most of it sunk, and the rest, destitute and
scattered, being chased by our ships into the northern latitudes,
and there left to be pursued by hunger and cold; a victory so
remarkable, that neither time nor age will ever wear the
remembrance thereof away.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;widowed Queen&rdquo; signifies the <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>Queen of
Scots, the mother of King James, who was beheaded at Fotheringhay
Castle, some say by the privity, others say to the great
discontent of Queen Elizabeth; a lady of sharp wit, undaunted
spirit, comely person, beautiful face, and majestic presence; a
fluent orator, and an excellent poetess, as appears by several
things of her writing now extant; she was beheaded on the 8th of
February, 1587, and was first buried in the choir of
Peterborough; and afterwards by her son, King James, solemnly
removed from thence to Westminster, where, in the south side of
the chapel of King Henry VII. he erected a stately monument to
her memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Harp&rdquo; signifies Ireland, as being the arms of
that country, when Queen Elizabeth, by reducing it to a <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>better
obedience, made it give a better sound, that is, made it more
civilized and profitable to the exchequer than it ever was
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Earl without a head be found.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
spoken of the Earl of Essex, one who was the favourite of the
queen and darling of the people (two things which seldom come
together), and yet could not both of them protect him from the
scaffold, but thereon he lost his head.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;English Rose&rdquo; is meant Queen Elizabeth, as
we said before, by whose death the right and title to the crown
came to James VI., King of Scotland, as lineally descended from
Margaret, eldest daughter to King Henry VII., the male issue
failing by the death of Queen Elizabeth; and here is to be
remembered the policy of King <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Henry VII., who having two
daughters, married the eldest of them to the King of Scotland,
and the youngest to the King of France, that if his male issue
should happen to fail, as it afterwards did, then Scotland might
wait upon England as the greater kingdom, and not England upon
France as the lesser.&nbsp; Besides, there was an old prophecy
which intimated King James coming to the English crown; for when
King Edward I. harassed Scotland, amongst other things he brought
from thence their royal chair (still preserved at the Abbey, in
Westminster), upon which chair these verses were written:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If Fates go right, where&rsquo;er this
chair is pight,<br />
The regal race of Scots shall rule that place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which by the coronation of King James there performed, made
good the words of the prophecy.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>&ldquo;The Northern Lion over Tweed,<br />
The maiden Queen shall then succeed,<br />
And join in one, two mighty States;<br />
Janus then shall shut his gates;<br />
Hell&rsquo;s power, by a fatal blow,<br />
Shall seek the land to overthrow,<br />
Which by mistake shall be reverst,<br />
And heads from shoulders be disperst.<br />
The British Olive next shall twine<br />
In marriage with the German Vine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next follows the remarkable actions of King James&rsquo;s
reign, predicted in the foregoing lines, which may be thus
explained:</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;Northern Lion&rdquo; is meant King James, and by
the &ldquo;maiden Queen,&rdquo; Queen Elizabeth, whom King James,
being King of Scotland, succeeded to the English crown, joining
thereby the two nations of England and Scotland, which had often
been attempted before.</p>
<p>The lines &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s power,&rdquo; etc., have <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>reference
to the Gunpowder Plot, which was planned to blow up the
Parliament House with gunpowder&mdash;king, princes, peers,
bishops, judges, knights, and burgesses, being all designed to
destruction.&nbsp; To bring the purpose about, a vault was hired
under the Parliament House, wherein were stowed thirty-six
barrels of gunpowder, with several iron bars, to make the force
of the fire more effectual, all which were covered with billets
and coals.&nbsp; The 5th of November, the day of Parliament first
sitting, was the time appointed to put this design in execution;
but Providence had ordered it otherwise, that those who intended
mischief should taste the effects of it.&nbsp; In the evening
before, Lord Monteagle received a strange letter from an unknown
hand, without date or name to it, and which, when it was opened,
<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>was even
still sealed.&nbsp; The letter being communicated to the king, he
commanded the rooms under the Parliament House to be searched,
where the mystery of iniquity was quickly discovered.&nbsp; Some
of the traitors were taken in London, others in the country; the
hands of justice overtaking them, they became its examples, and
tasted of that cup which they intended others should have drunk
of.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;British Olive&rdquo; is meant the Lady
Elizabeth, daughter of King James; and by the &ldquo;German
Vine&rdquo; the most illustrious Prince Frederic, Count Palatine
of the Rhine.&nbsp; This Lady Elizabeth was enriched with all the
endowments of both body and mind which make to the completing of
a princess; most dearly beloved of the English, as one that
deserved well of <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>all.&nbsp; They were married with great solemnity at
Westminster, February 14, 1602.</p>
<p>Mother Shipton having proceeded thus far with her prophecies,
broke up abruptly with a deep sigh, the tears trickling down her
cheeks, accompanied by a wringing of her hands, as if some
extraordinary mischance had befallen her.&nbsp; The abbot
wondered greatly what should be the cause of this sudden
alteration, having observed all along before a settled
composedness in her countenance, and now to break out in such
exclamations.&nbsp; He therefore said unto her, &ldquo;Mother
Shipton, it is more than some extraordinary matter which hath
made you break out into this sudden passion; and if it may not be
troublesome unto you, I shall desire that, as hitherto you have
not been scrupulous in revealing <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>those secrets unto me, which have
wrought in me both wonder and amazement, so that you will not so
abruptly break off as to leave me in suspense of the cause of
your sorrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! Mr. Abbot,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;who can with dry eyes repeat what must next ensue, or but
think upon it without a heart full of agony? to see virtue
trampled on, and vice exalted; beggars on horseback, and princes
on foot; the innocent condemned, and the bloodthirsty go scot
free; but since my promise binds me to fulfil your request, I
shall proceed from where I left off:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The crown then fits the White King&rsquo;s
head,<br />
Who with the Lilies soon shall wed;<br />
Then shall a peasant&rsquo;s bloody knife<br />
Deprive a great man of his life.<br />
Forth from the North shall mischief blow,<br />
And English hob shall add thereto.<br />
Then shall the Council great assemble,<br />
Who shall make great and small to tremble,<br />
<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>The
White King then (O grief to see!)<br />
By wicked hands shall murdered be.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the &ldquo;White King,&rdquo; is meant King Charles I., so
called not only in respect of the purity and uprightness of his
life, signified by white; but also at the time of his coronation
he was clothed in white.&nbsp; He had, previous to the death of
King James, married the Lady Henrietta Maria, daughter of Henry
IV., King of France; who is hereupon said to wed the
&ldquo;Lilies,&rdquo; the lilies being the arms of France.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;great man,&rdquo; who was to lose his life by a
bloody knife, was meant the Duke of Buckingham, the greatest man
in favour of those times, and (as is commonly seen) most hated of
the people, who laid the blame of all miscarriages in state upon
him; being made general for the relief of Rochelle (then besieged
<a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>by the
French forces), before he embarked at Portsmouth, he was stabbed
by one Felton, an officer in his army; who, so far from flying
for the same, though he might pass away undiscovered, boldly
avowed himself to be the man that did it.&nbsp; He was hanged in
chains at Portsmouth, in the year 1627.</p>
<p>The next part of this prophecy alludes to that ancient
proverb, &ldquo;From the cold &lsquo;North&rsquo; all ills come
forth,&rdquo; and may be understood of our troubles commencing in
1630, taking their original rise from Scotland, and fermented by
several factious spirits in England, the venom of which poison so
infected the veins of the English, that it broke forth into a
most bitter war, and ended not but with the deaths of many
thousands of people.</p>
<p>By the &ldquo;great Council&rdquo; is meant the <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>long-lasting Parliament, as known to all posterity for
the remarkable transactions therein.&nbsp; By them fell the wise
Strafford, and Reverend Laud; by them was Episcopacy voted down,
and Presbytery voted up; by them was the common-prayer denied,
and the Directory exalted; by them was the Church and State
turned topsy-turvy; but this cannot be reported of all amongst
them; many of them hated their doings, dissented from them, and
suffered by them.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;White King by wicked hands,&rdquo; etc., alludes to
the beheading of King Charles I., who was the principal victim of
these savage wars.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The White King dead, the Wolf shall then<br
/>
With blood possess the Lion&rsquo;s den.<br />
But Death shall hurry him away;<br />
Confusion shall awhile bear sway;<br />
But Fate to England shall restore<br />
A king to reign as heretofore.<br />
<a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>Great
death in London shall be though,<br />
And men on tops of houses go.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the &ldquo;White King,&rdquo; as we said before, is meant
King Charles I., and, by the &ldquo;Wolf,&rdquo; Oliver Cromwell,
whose ambition was such that he left no means unattempted until
he had got into the &ldquo;Lion&rsquo;s den,&rdquo; that is to
say, until he had attained the sole government.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But Death shall hurry him away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very remarkable was the day in which the Protector died, being
September 3, 1658, wherein the wind was so violent, that it
overthrew many houses, tore up many trees by the roots, tumbled
down chimneys, and unroofed barns and stables; but it is a very
ill wind that blows none good, so with all the hurt this wind
did, it made <a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>recompense to some folks who had lost their estates in
the civil wars, by blowing this Oliver away.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But fate to England shall restore<br />
A king to reign as heretofore.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which part of the prophecy was fulfilled in the restoration of
King Charles II., which put a period to all the Commonwealth, and
restored the land to its ancient government.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great death in London,&rdquo; verified by the great
plague in London, in 1665, which, for number, was the greatest
that hath been known in these latter centuries of years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And men on tops of houses go.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
suddenly fulfilled in that great conflagration of fire which
happened in London, September 2, 3, and 4, 1666, by which so many
houses were <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>destroyed, that men afterwards, in the ruins, went on
the tops of those houses whose lofty structures not long before
seemed to brave the sky.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It will be observed that some of the following prophecies of
Mother Shipton relate to the present time, while others more
closely concern the future.&nbsp; We will leave them to the
reader&rsquo;s own interpretation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I.</p>
<p>Ploughed with swords the earth shall be,<br />
And blood will mingle with the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II.</p>

<p>In England, now will come to pass<br />
A house that shall be built of glass.</p>

<p><i>The following remarkable Prophecy</i>, <i>which is known
as</i> &ldquo;<i>Mother Shipton&rsquo;s prophecies</i>,&rdquo;

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Here follow other Prophecies which Mother Shipton stated at
various times in her life to different persons</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The first coming in of the King of the Scots
(James I.) shall be at Holgate Town, but he shall not come
through the bar.&nbsp; And when the King of the North shall be at
London Bridge, his tail shall be at Edinburgh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was fulfilled in the following manner&mdash;When King
James arrived there was such a multitude of people at Holgate bar
to behold him, that to <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>avoid the danger of the crush he was
forced to ride another way.&nbsp; When King James was at London,
his children were at Edinburgh, preparing to come into
England.</p>
<blockquote><p>Water shall come over Ouse Bridge, and a windmill
shall be set upon a Tower, and a Elm Tree shall lie at every
man&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; At that day women shall wear great hats
and great bands.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was verified by the conducting of water into York streets
through bored Elms; and the Conduit-house had a windmill on the
top that drew up the water.</p>
<blockquote><p>When there is a Lord Mayor living in Minster-yard
in York, let him beware of a stab.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Lord Mayor, whose house was in Minster-yard, was stabbed by
an assassin in three places, which caused his death.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>When two Knights shall fall out in the York
Castle-yard, they shall never live kindly all their after
lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sir Thomas Wentworth and Sir John Savile in choosing Knights
for the Shire in the Castle-yard at York, did so fall out, that
they were never after well reconciled.</p>
<blockquote><p>When all Colton-hag hath borne crops and corn for
seven years; seven years after that you shall hear news.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Colton-hag in Mother Shipton&rsquo;s time was a woodland
ground full of trees, which some long time after her death was
cultivated and bore crops and corn for seven years; and the seven
years after that, was the year of the coming in of the Scots, and
their taking of Newcastle.</p>
<blockquote><p>You shall have a year of pining hunger, and <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>then a
dearth without corn.&nbsp; You shall not know of the war
over-night, yet you shall have it in the morning; and when it
comes it shall last three years.</p>
<p>Between Calder and Aire<br />
Shall be great warfare,<br />
When all the world is aloft,<br />
It shall be called Christ&rsquo;s Croft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calder and Aire are two rivers in Yorkshire; and this Prophecy
relates to the Civil War in the time of Charles I.</p>
<blockquote><p>When the battle of warfare begins, it shall be
where Crookback Richard made his fray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was near Leicester where Richard the Third was slain in
battle.&nbsp; There Colonel Hastings was one of the first in arms
at the commencement of the civil war.&nbsp; Or it may thus be
understood&mdash;That as King Richard began his march from
Nottingham when he first set out against the Earl of Richmond, so
also <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>should these wars take rise from thence.&nbsp; And
indeed at Nottingham, on Aug. 25th, 1640, Charles I. set up his
standard, and there continued it to little purpose.</p>
<blockquote><p>They shall say to warfare for your King for
half-a-crown a day, but stir not.&nbsp; They will say to warfare
for your King on pain of hanging, but stir not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of the Civil War in 1642, many Lords promised two
shillings and sixpence a day for each horseman who would join the
King&rsquo;s service.</p>
<blockquote><p>For he that goes to complain,<br />
Shall not come back again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to refer to the Welsh and the Irish serving the
King, for very few lived to return back again to their own
country.</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span><i>The following Prophecies by Mother Shipton</i>,
(<i>extracted from Lilly&rsquo;s collection</i>, <i>with his
remarks</i>,) <i>being rather quaint in the composition</i>,
<i>are left for the reader to decypher</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>) There will be a great battel between
England and Scotland, and they will be pacified for a time; and
when they come at (<i>b</i>) Bramma-moore they fight, and are
again pacified for a time: Then there will be a great battel
between England and Scotland at (<i>c</i>) Knavesmore: Then they
will be pacified for a while: Then there will be a great battel
between England and Scotland at (<i>d</i>) Storktonmore; then
will Ravens sit on the (<i>e</i>) Crosse, and drink as much blood
of Nobles as of the Commons.&nbsp; Then wo is me, for London
shall be destroyed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(<i>a</i>) God I hope will prevent this threatened
mischief.&nbsp; (<i>b</i>) Brammish is a river in
Northumberland.&nbsp; (<i>c</i>) I conceive it should be
Knaresborough, by which the river Nidd runs.&nbsp; (<i>d</i>) <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Storkton I
conceive mistaken for Stanemore, in Richmondshire.&nbsp;
(<i>e</i>) It is to be noted and admired, that this Crosse in the
North in Mother Shipton&rsquo;s days, was a tall stone Crosse
which ever since hath been by degrees sinking into the ground,
and is now (1640) sunk so low, that a Raven may sit upon the top
of it and reach her bill to the ground.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then will come a woman with one eye, and she shall
tread in men&rsquo;s blood to the knee; and she shall meet a man
leaning on a staff, and shall say to him, What art thou? and he
shall say, I am King of the Scots.&nbsp; And she shall say, Go
with me to my house, for there are three Knights.&nbsp; And he
will go up with her, and stay there three days and three
nights.&nbsp; Then will England be lost; and they will cry twice
in one day, England is lost.&nbsp; Then there will be three
Knights in Petergate in York, and the one shall not know of the
other.&nbsp; There shall be a child born in Pomfret with three

There will three Knights go into Crouch-Church, and but one of

<p>Mother Shipton, the authoress of these Prophecies, continued
for years esteemed as the Sybil or Oracle of her time; <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>and though
she was generally believed to be a Witch, yet all persons that
either saw or heard of her, held her in great esteem, and her
memory is much honoured by those of her own country, especially
in Yorkshire.&nbsp; A long time before her death, she foretold
the day and hour she was to take her departure; and the time
approaching which she had Prophecied, and which was in the year
1561; she took solemn leave of her friends, who were all greatly
attached to her, laid down on her bed, and died, at the good old
age of 75 years.&nbsp; Many more &ldquo;<i>Prophecies</i>&rdquo;
are current in Yorkshire as of her utterance, but the Publisher
being unable to find them either properly authenticated, or in
any old works, they have been omitted, being desirous of not
adding anything which <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>might tend to destroy her sterling
reputation.</p>
<p>A stone was erected to her memory near Clifton, about a mile
from the city of York, upon which was the following
inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here lyes she who never ly&rsquo;d<br />
Whose skill often has been try&rsquo;d;<br />
Her prophecies shall still survive,<br />
And ever keep her name alive.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
MARTHA, THE GIPSY.</h2>
<p>London may appear an unbefitting scene for a story so romantic
as that which I have here set down: but, strange and wild as is
the tale I have to tell, <i>it is true</i>; and, therefore, the
scene of action shall not be changed; nor will I alter or vary
from the truth, save that the names of the personages, in my
domestic drama shall be fictitious.</p>
<p>To say that I am superstitious would be, in the minds of many
wise personages, to write myself down an ass; but to say that I
do not believe <i>that</i> which <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>follows, as I am sure it was
believed by <i>him</i> who related it to me, would be to
discredit the testimony of a friend, as honourable and as brave
as ever trod the earth.&nbsp; He has been snatched from the
world, of which he was a bright ornament, and has left more than
his sweet suffering widow and his orphan children affectionately
to deplore his loss.</p>
<p>It is, I find, right and judicious most carefully and publicly
to disavow a belief in supernatural visitings: but it will be
long before I become either so wise or so bold as to make any
such unqualified declaration.&nbsp; I am not weak enough to
imagine myself surrounded by spirits and phantoms, or jostling
through a crowd of spectres, as I walk the streets; neither do I
give credence to all the idle tales of ancient dames, or
frightened children, touching such <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>matters: but when I breathe the air,
and see the grass grow under my feet, I cannot but feel that HE
who gives me ability to inhale the one, and stand erect upon the
other, has also the power to use for special purposes such means
and agency, as in his wisdom he may see fit; and which, in point
of fact, are not more incomprehensible to us than the very
simplest effects which we every day witness, arising from unknown
causes.</p>
<p>Philosophers may pore, and in the might of their littleness,
and the erudition of their ignorance develope and disclose, argue
and discuss; but when the sage, who sneers at the possibility of
ghosts, will explain to me the doctrine of attraction and
gravitation, or tell me why the wind blows, why the tides ebb and
flow, or why the light <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>shines&mdash;effects perceptible to
all men&mdash;then will I admit the justice of his
incredulity&mdash;then will I join the ranks of the
incredulous.&nbsp; However, a truce with my views and
reflections: proceed we to the narrative.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Bedford-square lived a respectable and
honest man, whose name the reader will be pleased to consider
Harding.&nbsp; He married early: his wife was an exemplary woman,
and his son and daughter were grown to that companionable age, at
which children repay, with their society and accomplishments, the
tender cares which parents bestow upon their offspring in their
early infancy.</p>
<p>Mr. Harding held a responsible and respectable situation under
the government, in Somerset House.&nbsp; His income was adequate
to his wants and wishes; <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>his family a family of love: and,
perhaps, taking into consideration the limited desires of what
may be fairly called middle life, no man was ever more contented,
or better satisfied with his lot than he.</p>
<p>Maria Harding, his daughter, was a modest, unassuming, and
interesting girl, full of feeling and gentleness.&nbsp; She was
timid and retiring; but the modesty which cast down her fine
black eyes could not veil the intellect which beamed in
them.&nbsp; Her health was by no means strong; and the paleness
of her cheek&mdash;too frequently, alas! lighted by the hectic
flush of our indigenous complaint&mdash;gave a deep interest to
her countenance.&nbsp; She was watched and reared by her tender
mother, with all the care and attention which a being so delicate
and so <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>ill-suited to the perils and troubles of this world
demanded.</p>
<p>George, her brother, was a bold and intelligent lad, full of
rude health, and fearless independence.&nbsp; His character was
frequently the subject of his father&rsquo;s contemplation; and
he saw in his disposition, his mind, his pursuits, and
propensities, the promise of future success in active life.</p>
<p>With these children, possessing as they did the most enviable
characteristics of their respective sexes, Mr. and Mrs. Harding,
with thankfulness to Providence, acknowledged their happiness,
and their perfect satisfaction with the portion assigned to them
in this transitory world.</p>
<p>Maria was about nineteen, and had, as was natural, attracted
the regards, and thence gradually chained the <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>affections,
of a distant relative, whose ample fortune, added to his personal
and mental good qualities, rendered him a most acceptable suitor
to her parents, which Maria&rsquo;s heart silently acknowledged
he would have been to <i>her</i>, had he been poor and
penniless.</p>
<p>The father of this intended husband of Maria was a man of
importance, possessing much personal interest, through which
George, the brother of his intended daughter-in-law, was to be
placed in that diplomatic seminary in Downing-street, whence, in
due time, he was to rise through all the grades of office,
(which, with his peculiar talents, his friends, and especially
his mother, was convinced he would so ably fill,) and at last
turn out an ambassador.</p>
<p>The parents, however, of young Langdale and of Maria Harding
were agreed, <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>that there was no necessity for hastening the alliance
between their families, seeing that the united ages of the couple
did not exceed thirty-nine years: and seeing, moreover, still,
that Mrs. Langdale, who was little more than six-and-thirty years
of age herself, had reasons, which she also meant to be private,
for seeking to delay as much as possible a ceremony, the result
of which, in all probability, would confer upon her, somewhat too
early in life to be agreeable to a lady of her habits and
propensities, the formidable title of grand-mamma.</p>
<p>How curious it is, when one takes up a <i>little bit</i> of
society (as a geologist crumbles and twists a bit of earth in his
hand, to ascertain its character and quality,) to look into the
motives and man&oelig;uvrings of all the persons connected with
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>it; the
various workings, the indefatigable labours, which all their
little minds are undergoing to bring about divers and sundry
little points, perfectly unconnected with the great end in view;
but which for private and hidden objects, each of them is toiling
to carry.&nbsp; Nobody, but those who really understood Mrs.
Langdale, understood why she so readily acquiesced in the desire
of her husband to postpone the marriage for another
twelvemonth.&nbsp; A stranger would have seen only the dutiful
wife according with the sensible husband; but I knew her, and
knew that there must be something more than met the eye, or the
ear, in that sympathy of feeling between her and Mr. Langdale,
which was not upon ordinary occasions so evidently displayed.</p>
<p>Like the Waterman who pulls one <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>way and looks another, Mrs. Langdale
aided the entreaties and seconded the commands of her loving
spouse, touching the seasonable delay of which I am speaking; and
it was agreed, that immediately after the coming of age of
Frederick Langdale, and not before, he was to lead to the
hymeneal altar the delicate and timid Maria Harding.</p>
<p>The affair got whispered about; George&rsquo;s fortune in life
was highly extolled&mdash;Maria&rsquo;s excessive happiness
prophesied by everybody of their acquaintance; and already had
sundry younger ladies, daughters and nieces of those who
discussed these matters in divan after dinner, began to look upon
Miss Harding with envy and maliciousness, and wonder what Mr.
Frederick Langdale could see in her: she was proclaimed to be
insipid, inanimate, shy, bashful, and <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>awkward: nay, some of her female
friends went so far as to discover that she was absolutely
awry.</p>
<p>Still, however, Frederick and Maria went loving on; and their
hearts grew as one; so truly, so fondly were they attached to
each other.&nbsp; George, who was somewhat of a plague to the
pair of lovers, was luckily at Oxford, reading away till his head
ached, to qualify himself for a degree, and the distant duties of
the office whence he was to cull the bunches of diplomatic
laurels, and whence were to issue rank and title, and ribbons and
crosses innumerable.</p>
<p>Things were in this prosperous state, the bark of life rolling
gaily along before the breeze, when as Mr. Harding was one day
proceeding from his residence, to his office in Somerset-place,
through Charlotte-street, Bloomsbury, he was <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>accosted by
one of those female gypsies who are found begging in the
metropolis, and especially in the particular part of it in
question: &lsquo;Pray remember poor Martha, the gipsy,&rsquo;
said the woman: &lsquo;give me a halfpenny for charity, sir, pray
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harding was a subscriber to the Mendicity Society, an
institution which proposes to check begging by the novel mode of
giving nothing to the poor: moreover, he was a
magistrate&mdash;moreover, he had no change; and he somewhat
sternly desired the woman to go about her business.</p>
<p>All availed him nothing; she still followed him, and
reiterated the piteous cry, &lsquo;Pray remember poor Martha, the
gipsy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At length, irritated by the perseverance of the
woman&mdash;for even <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>subordinates in government hate to
be solicited importunately&mdash;Mr. Harding, contrary to his
usual custom, and contrary to the customary usages of modern
society, turned hastily round, and fulminated an oath against the
supplicating vagrant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Curse!&rsquo; said Martha; &lsquo;have I lived to
this?&nbsp; Hark ye, man&mdash;poor, weak, haughty man!&nbsp;
Mark me, sir&mdash;look at me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did look at her; and beheld a countenance on fire with
rage.&nbsp; A pair of eyes blacker than jet, and brighter than
diamonds, glared like stars upon him; her black hair dishevelled,
hung over her olive cheeks; and a row of teeth whiter than the
driven snow displaying themselves from between a pair of coral
lips, in a dreadful smile, a ghastly sneer of contempt which
mingled in her passion.&nbsp; Harding was riveted to <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>the spot;
and, affected partly by the powerful fascination of her
superhuman countenance, and partly by the dread of a disturbance
in the street, he paused to listen to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mark me, sir,&rsquo; said Martha; &lsquo;you and I
shall meet again.&nbsp; Thrice shall you see me before you
die.&nbsp; My visitings will be dreadful; but the third will be
the last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a solemnity in this declaration which struck to his
very heart, coming too as it did only from a vagrant
outcast.&nbsp; Passengers were approaching; and wishing, he knew
not why, to soothe the ire of the angry woman, he mechanically
drew from his pocket some silver, which he tendered to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, my good woman&mdash;there,&rsquo; said he,
stretching forth his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good woman!&rsquo; retorted the hag, <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&lsquo;Money now?&nbsp; I&mdash;I that have been
cursed! &rsquo;tis all too late, proud gentleman&mdash;the deed
is done, the curse be now on you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Saying which, she
huddled her ragged red cloak about her shoulders, and hurried
from his sight, into the deep and dreary recesses of St.
Giles&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Harding experienced, as she vanished from his eye, a most
extraordinary sensation: he felt grieved that he had spoken so
harshly to the poor creature, and returned his shillings to his
pocket with regret.&nbsp; Of course, fear of the fulfilment of
her predictions did not mingle with any of his feelings on the
occasion; and he proceeded to his office in Somerset-place, and
performed all the arduous official duties of reading the
opposition newspapers, discussing the leading politics of the day
with the head of <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>another department, and signing his name three times,
before four o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Martha the gipsy, however, although he had
&lsquo;poophoohed&rsquo; her out of his memory, would ever and
anon flash across his mind; her figure was indelibly stamped upon
his recollection; and though, of course, as I before said, a man
of his firmness and intellect could care nothing, one way or
another, for the maledictions of an ignorant, illiterate gipsy,
still his feelings&mdash;whence arising I know not&mdash;prompted
him to call a hackney-coach, and proceed <i>en voiture</i> to his
house rather than run the risk of again encountering the
metropolitan sibyl, under whose forcible denunciation he was
actually labouring.</p>
<p>There is a period in each day of the lives of married people,
at which, I am given to understand, a more than <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>ordinarily
unreserved communication of facts and feelings takes place; when
all the world is shut out, and the two beings, who are in truth
&lsquo;but only one,&rsquo; commune together freely and fully
upon the occurrences of the past day.&nbsp; At this period, the
else sacred secrets of the drawing-room coterie, and the
<i>tellable</i> jokes of the after-dinner convivialist, are
mutually interchanged by the fond pair, who, by the barbarous
customs of uncivilized Britain, have been separated during part
of the preceding evening.</p>
<p>Then it is, that the husband informs his anxious consort how
he has forwarded his worldly views with such a man&mdash;how he
has carried his point in such a quarter&mdash;what he thinks of
the talents of one, of the character of another; while the
communicative wife gives <i>her</i> views of the same subjects,
founded upon what <a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>she has gathered from the individuals composing the
female cabinet, and explains why she thinks he must have been
deceived upon this point, or misled upon that.&nbsp; And thus, in
recounting, in arguing, in discussing, and descanting, the
blended interests of the happy pair are strengthened, their best
hopes nourished, and perhaps eventually realized.</p>
<p>A few friends at dinner, and some refreshers in the evening,
had prevented Harding from saying a word to his beloved Eliza
about the gipsy; and perhaps, till the &lsquo;witching
time&rsquo; which I have attempted to define, he would not have
mentioned the circumstance, even had they been alone.&nbsp; Most
certainly he did not think the less of the horrible vision; and
when the company had dispersed, and the affectionate couple had
retired to rest, he stated the <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>circumstance exactly as it had
occurred, and received from his fair lady just such an answer as
a prudent, intelligent, and discreet woman of sense would give to
such a communication.&nbsp; She vindicated his original
determination not to be imposed upon&mdash;wondered at his
subsequent willingness to give to such an undeserving object,
particularly while he had three or four soup tickets in his
pocket&mdash;was somewhat surprised that he had not consigned the
bold intruder to the hands of the beadle&mdash;and, ridiculing
the impression which the hag&rsquo;s appearance seemed to have
made upon her husband&rsquo;s mind, narrated a tour performed by
herself and some friends to Norwood, when she was a girl, and
when one of those very women had told her fortune, not one word
of which ever came true&mdash;and, in a discussion of some <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>length,
animadverting strongly upon the weakness and impiety of putting
faith in the sayings of such idle creatures, she fell fast
asleep.</p>
<p>Not so Harding: he was restless and worried, and felt that he
would give the world to be able to recall the curse which he had
rashly uttered against the poor woman.&nbsp; Helpless as she was
and in distress, why did his passion conquer his judgment?&nbsp;
Why did he add to the bitterness of refusal the sting of
malediction?&nbsp; However, it was useless to regret that which
was past&mdash;and, wearied and mortified with his reflection, he
at length followed his better half into that profound slumber,
which the length and subject of his harangue had so comfortably
ensured her.</p>
<p>The morning came, and brightly beamed the sun&mdash;that is,
as brightly as <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>it ever beams in London.&nbsp; The office-hour arrived;
and Mr. Harding proceeded, <i>not</i> by Charlotte-street, to
Somerset-house, such was his dread of seeing the ominous
woman.&nbsp; It is impossible to describe the effect produced
upon him by the apprehension of encountering her: if he heard a
female voice behind him in the street, he trembled, and feared to
look round, lest he should behold Martha.&nbsp; In turning a
corner he proceeded carefully and cautiously, lest he should come
upon her unexpectedly; in short, wherever he went, whatever he
did, his actions, his movements, his very words, were controlled
and constrained by the horror of beholding her again.</p>
<p>The malediction she had uttered rang incessantly in his ears;
nay, such possession had it taken of him, that he had written <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>the words
down, and sealed the document which contained them.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Thrice you shall see me before you die.&nbsp; My visitings
will be dreadful, but the third will be the last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Calais&rsquo; was not more deeply imprinted on our
Queen&rsquo;s heart, than these lines upon that of Mr. Harding;
but he was ashamed of the strength of his feelings, and placed
the paper wherein he had recorded them at the very bottom of his
desk.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Frederick Langdale was unremitting in his attentions
to Maria; but, as is too often the case, the bright sunshine of
their loves was clouded.&nbsp; Her health, always delicate, now
appeared more so, and at times her anxious parents felt a
solicitude upon her account, new to them; for decided symptoms of
consumption had shown themselves, <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>which the faculty, although they
spoke of them lightly to the fond mother and to the gentle
patient, treated with such care and caution, as gave alarm to
those who could see the progress of the fatal disease, which was
unnoticed by Maria herself, who anticipated parties, and
pleasure, and gaieties, in the coming spring, which the doctors
thought it but too probable she might never enjoy.</p>
<p>That Mr. Langdale&rsquo;s &lsquo;punctilio,&rsquo; or Mrs.
Langdale&rsquo;s excessive desire for apparent juvenility, should
have induced the postponement of Maria&rsquo;s marriage, was,
indeed, a melancholy circumstance.&nbsp; The agitation, the
surprise, the hope deferred, which weighed upon the sweet
girl&rsquo;s mind, and that doubting dread of something
unexpected, which lovers always feel, bore down her spirits, and
injured her health; whereas, had the <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>marriage been celebrated, the relief
she would have experienced from all her apprehensions, added to
the tour of France and Italy, which the happy couple were to make
immediately after their union, would have restored her health,
while it ensured her happiness.&nbsp; This, however, was not to
be.</p>
<p>It was now three months since poor Mr. Harding&rsquo;s
rencontre with Martha; and habit, and time, and constant
avocation, had conspired to free his mind from the dread she at
first inspired.&nbsp; Again he smiled and joked, again he enjoyed
society, and again dared to take the nearest road to Somerset
House; nay, he had so far recovered from the unaccountable terror
he had originally felt, that he went to his desk, and selecting
the paper wherein he had set down the awful denunciation of the
hag, <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>deliberately tore it into bits, and witnessed its
destruction in the fire, with something like real satisfaction,
and a determination never more to think upon so silly an
affair.</p>
<p>Frederick Langdale was, as usual, with his betrothed, and Mrs.
Harding enjoying the egotism of the lovers, (for, as I said
before, lovers think their conversation the most charming in the
world, because they talk of nothing but themselves) when his
curricle was driven to the door to convey him to
Tattersall&rsquo;s, where his father had commissioned him to look
at a horse, or horses, which he intended to purchase; for
Frederick was, of all things in the world, the best possible
judge of a horse.</p>
<p>To this sweeping dictum, pronounced by the young gentleman
himself, Mr. Harding, however, was not willing to <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>assent; and
therefore, in order to have the full advantage of two heads,
which, as the proverb says, are better than one, the worthy
father-in-law elect, proposed accompanying the youth to the
auctioneer&rsquo;s yard at Hyde-Park Corner, it being one of
those few privileged days when the labourers in our public
offices make holiday.&nbsp; The proposal was hailed with delight
by the young man, who, in order to show due deference to Mr.
Harding, gave him the reins, and bowing their adieus to the
ladies at the window, away they went, the splendid cattle of Mr.
Langdale prancing and curvetting, fire flaming from their eyes,
and smoke breathing from their nostrils.</p>
<p>The charioteer, however, soon found that the horses were
somewhat beyond his strength, even putting his skill wholly out
of the question, and in <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>turning into Russell-street,
proposed surrendering the reins to Frederick.&nbsp; By some
misunderstanding of words in the alarm which Harding felt,
Frederick did not take the reins which he (perfectly confounded)
tendered to him in great agitation.&nbsp; They slipped over the
dashing iron between the horse, who thus freed from restraint,
reared wildly in the air, and plunging forward, dashed the
vehicle against a post, and precipitated Frederick and Harding on
the curbstone; the off-horse kicked desperately as the carriage
became entangled and impeded, and struck Frederick a desperate
blow on the head.&nbsp; Harding, whose right arm and collar-bone
were broken, raised himself on his left hand, and saw Frederick
weltering in his blood, apparently lifeless before him.&nbsp; The
infuriated animals again plunged <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>forward with the shattered remnant
of the carriage, and as this object was removed from his sight,
the wretched father-in-law beheld, looking upon the scene with a
fixed and unruffled countenance&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Martha</span>, <span class="smcap">the
Gipsy</span>.</p>
<p>It was doubtful whether the appearance of this horrible
vision, coupled as it was with the verification of her prophecy,
had not a more dreadful effect upon Mr. Harding, than the sad
reality before him.&nbsp; He trembled, sickened, fainted, and
fell senseless on the ground.</p>
<p>Assistance was promptly procured, and the wounded sufferers
were carefully removed to their respective dwellings.&nbsp;
Frederick Langdale&rsquo;s sufferings were much greater than
those of his companion, and, in addition to severe fractures of
two of his limbs, the wound <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>upon his head presented a most
terrible appearance, and excited the greatest alarm in his
medical attendants.</p>
<p>Mr. Harding, whose temperate course of life was greatly
advantageous to his case, had suffered comparatively little: a
simple fracture of the arm, and dislocation of the collar-bone
(which was the extent of his misfortune,) were, by skilful
treatment and implicit obedience to professional commands, soon
pronounced in a state of improvement; but a wound had been
inflicted which no doctor could heal.&nbsp; The conviction that
the woman, whose anger he had incurred, had, if not the power of
producing evil, at least the power to foretell it, and that he
had twice again to see her before the fulfilment of her prophecy,
struck deep into his mind; and although he felt himself more at
ease when he had <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>communicated to Mrs. Harding the fact of having seen
the gipsy at the moment of the accident, it was impossible for
him to rally from the shock which his nerves had received.&nbsp;
It was in vain he had tried to shake off the perpetual
apprehension of again beholding her.</p>
<p>Frederick Langdale remained for some time in a very precarious
state.&nbsp; All visitors were excluded from his room, and a
wretched space of two months passed, during which his
affectionate Maria had never been allowed to see him, nor to
write to, nor to hear from him.&nbsp; While her constitution was
gradually giving way to the constant operation of solicitude and
sorrow.</p>
<p>Mr. Harding meanwhile recovered rapidly, but his spirits did
not keep pace with his mending health; the dread he felt of
quitting his house, the tremor <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>excited in his breast by a knocking
at the door, or the approach of a footstep, lest the intruder
should be the basilisk Martha, were not to be described; and the
appearance of his poor Maria did not tend to cheer the gloom
which hung over him.</p>
<p>When at length Frederick was sufficiently recovered to receive
visitors, Maria was not sufficiently well to visit him: she was
too rapidly sinking into an early grave, and even the physician
himself appeared desirous of preparing her parents for the worst,
while she, full of the symptomatic prospectiveness of disease,
still talked anticipatingly of future happiness, when Frederick
would be sufficiently re-established to visit her.</p>
<p>At length, however, the doctors suggested a change of
air&mdash;a suggestion <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>instantly attended to, but, alas!
too late; the weakness of the poor girl was such, that upon a
trial of her strength it was found inexpedient to attempt her
removal.</p>
<p>In this terrible state, separated from him whose all she was,
did the exemplary patient linger, and life seemed flickering in
her flushing cheek; and her eye was sunken, and her parched lip
quivered with pain.</p>
<p>It was at length agreed, that on the following day Frederick
Langdale might be permitted to visit her;&mdash;his varied
fractures were reduced, and the wound on the head had assumed a
favourable appearance.&nbsp; The carriage was ordered to convey
him to the Hardings at one, and the physicians advised by all
means that Maria should be apprized of and prepared for the
meeting the day <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>previous to its taking place.&nbsp; Those who are
parents, and those alone, will be able to understand the tender
solicitude, the wary caution with which both her father and
mother proceeded in a disclosure, so important as the medical men
thought to her recovery&mdash;so careful that the coming joy
should be imparted gradually to their suffering child, and that
all the mischiefs resulting from an abrupt announcement should be
avoided.</p>
<p>They sat down by her&mdash;spoke of Frederick&mdash;Maria
joined in the conversation&mdash;raised herself in her
bed&mdash;by degrees, hope was excited that she might soon again
see him&mdash;this hope was gradually improved into
certainty&mdash;the period at which it might occur spoken
of&mdash;that period again progressively diminished: the anxious
girl caught the whole truth&mdash;she knew it&mdash;she was
conscious <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>that she would behold him on the morrow&mdash;she burst
into a flood of tears and sank down upon her pillow.</p>
<p>At that moment the bright sun, which was shining in all its
splendour, beamed into the room, and fell strongly upon her
flushed countenance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Draw down the blind, my love,&rsquo; said Mrs. Harding
to her husband.&nbsp; Harding rose and proceeded to the
window.</p>
<p>A shriek of horror burst from him&mdash;&lsquo;She is
there!&rsquo; exclaimed the agitated man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo; cried his astonished wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&mdash;she&mdash;the horrid she!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Harding ran to the window and beheld, standing on the
opposite side of the street, with her eyes fixed attentively on
the house&mdash;<span class="smcap">Martha</span>, <span
class="smcap">the Gipsy</span>.</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>&lsquo;Draw down the blind, my love, and come away;
pray come away,&rsquo; said Mrs. Harding.</p>
<p>Harding drew down the blind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What evil is at hand?&nbsp; What misery is
impending?&rsquo; sobbed Harding.</p>
<p>A loud scream from his wife, who had returned to the bedside,
was the horrid answer to his painful question.</p>
<p>Maria was dead!</p>
<p>Twice of the thrice he had seen this dreadful fiend in human
shape; each visitation was (as she had foretold) to surpass the
preceding ones in its importance of horror.&mdash;What could
surpass this?</p>
<p>There, before the afflicted parents, lay their innocent child
stretched in the still sleep of death; neither of them believed
it true&mdash;it seemed like a dreadful dream.&nbsp; Harding was
bewildered, and <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>turned from the corpse of his beloved to the window he
had just left.&mdash;Martha was gone&mdash;and he heard her
singing a wild and joyous air at the other end of the street.</p>
<p>The servants were summoned&mdash;medical aid was called
in&mdash;but it was all too late! and the wretched parents were
doomed to mourn their loved, their lost Maria!&nbsp; George, her
fond and affectionate brother, who was at Oxford, hastened from
all the academic honours which were awaiting him, to follow to
the grave his beloved sister.</p>
<p>The effect upon Frederick Langdale was most dreadful: it was
supposed he would never recover from a shock so great, and at the
moment so unexpected; for, although the delicacy of her
constitution was a perpetual source of uneasiness and solicitude,
still the <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>immediate symptoms had taken rather a favourable turn
during the last few days of her life, and had re-invigorated the
hopes which those who so dearly loved her entertained of her
eventual recovery.&nbsp; Of this distressed young man I never
indeed heard anything, till about three years after, when I saw
it announced in the papers that he was just married to the only
daughter of a rich west-country baronet, which event, if wanted
to work another proverb here, would afford me a most admirable
opportunity of doing so.</p>
<p>The death of poor Maria, and the dread which her father
entertained of the third visitation of Martha, made a complete
change in the affairs of the family.&nbsp; By the exertion of
powerful interest, he obtained an appointment for his son to act
as his deputy in the office <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>which he held, and having achieved
this desired object, resolved on leaving England for a time, and
quitting a neighbourhood in which he must be perpetually exposed
to the danger which he was now perfectly convinced was
inseparable from his next interview with the weird woman.</p>
<p>George, of course, thus checked in his classical pursuits,
left Oxford, and at the early age of nineteen commenced active
official life, not certainly in the particular department which
his mother had selected for his <i>deb&ucirc;t</i>; and it was
somewhat observable, that the Langdales, after the death of
Maria, not only abstained from frequent intercourse with the
Hardings during their stay in England, but that the mighty
professions of the purse-proud citizen dwindled by degrees into
an absolute forgetfulness of <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>any promise, even conditional, to
exert an interest for their son.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Mr. Harding felt that he should act prudentially,
by endeavouring to place his son where in the course of time, he
might perhaps attain to that situation, from whose honourable
revenue he could live like a gentleman, and &lsquo;settle
comfortably.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All the arrangements which the kind father had proposed, being
made, the mourning couple proceeded on a lengthened tour of the
continent; and it was evident that his spirits mended rapidly,
when he felt conscious that his liability to encounter Martha had
decreased.&nbsp; The sorrow of mourning was soothed and softened
in the common course of nature, and the quiet domesticated couple
sat themselves down at Lausanne, &lsquo;the world forgetting, by
the world forgot,&rsquo; <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>except by their excellent and
exemplary son, whose good qualities, it seems, had captivated a
remarkable pretty girl, a neighbour of his, whose mother seemed
to be equally charmed with the goodness of his income.</p>
<p>There appeared, strange to say, in this love affair, no
difficulties to be surmounted, no obstacles to be overcome; and
the consent of the Hardings (requested in a letter, which also
begged them to be present at the ceremony, if they were willing
it should take place,) was presently obtained by George; and at
the close of the second year, which had passed since their
departure, the parents and son were again assembled in that
house, the sight of which recalled to their recollection their
unhappy daughter, and her melancholy fate, and which was still
associated most <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>painfully in the mind of Mr. Harding with the hated
Gipsy.</p>
<p>The charm, however, had, no doubt, been broken.&nbsp; In the
two past years, Martha was probably either dead or gone from the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Gypsies were a wandering tribe&mdash;and why
should she be an exception to a general rule?&mdash;and thus Mrs.
Harding checked the rising apprehensions and renewed uneasiness
of her husband; and so well did she succeed, that when the
wedding-day came, and the bells rang, and the favours fluttered
in the air, his countenance was lighted up with smiles, and he
kissed the glowing cheek of his new daughter-in-law with warmth,
and something like happiness.</p>
<p>The wedding took place at that season of the year when friends
and families meet jovially and harmoniously, <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>when all
little bickerings are forgotten, and when, by a general feeling
founded upon religion, and perpetuated by the memory of the
blessings granted to the world by the Almighty, an universal
amnesty is proclaimed; when the cheerful fire, and teeming board,
announce that Christmas is come, and mirth and gratulation are
the order of the day.</p>
<p>It unfortunately happened, however, that to the account of
Miss Wilkinson&rsquo;s marriage with George Harding, I am not
permitted, in truth, to add, that they left town in a travelling
carriage and four, to spend the honeymoon.&nbsp; Three or four
days permitted absence from his office, alone, were devoted to
the celebration of the nuptials, and it was agreed that the whole
party, together with the younger branches of the
Wilkinson&rsquo;s, their cousins and second <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>cousins,
etc., should meet on twelfth-night to celebrate, in a juvenile
party, the return of the bride and bridegroom to their home.</p>
<p>When the night came, it was delightful to see the happy faces
of the smiling youngsters: it was a pleasure to behold them
pleased&mdash;a participation in which, since the highest amongst
us, and the most accomplished prince in Europe, annually evinces
the gratification he feels in such sights, I am by no means
disposed to disclaim.&nbsp; And merry was the jest, and gaily did
the evening pass; and Mr. Harding, surrounded by his youthful
guests, smiled, and for a season forgot his care; yet, as he
glanced around the room, he could not suppress a sigh, when he
recollected, that in that very room his darling Maria had <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>entertained
her little parties on the anniversary of the same day in former
years.</p>
<p>Supper was announced early, and the gay throng bounded down
stairs to the parlour, where an abundance of the luxuries of
middle life crowded the board.&nbsp; In the centre appeared the
great object of the feast&mdash;a huge twelfth-cake; and gilded
kings and queens stood lingering over circles of scarlet
sweet-meats, and hearts of sugar lay enshrined with warlike
trophies of the same material.</p>
<p>Many and deep were the wounds the mighty heap received, and
every guest watched with a deep anxiety the coming portion,
relatively to the glittering splendour with which its frosted
surface was adorned.&nbsp; Character cards, illustrated with
pithy mottoes, and smart sayings, were distributed; and by one of
those little frauds which, in such <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>societies, are always tolerated, Mr.
Harding was announced as king, and the new bride as queen; and
there was such charming joking, and such harmless merriment
abounding, that he looked to his wife with an expression of
content, which she had often, but vainly, sought to find upon his
countenance, since the death of his dear child.</p>
<p>Supper concluded, the clock struck twelve, and the elders
looked as if it were time for the young ones to depart.&nbsp; One
half-hour&rsquo;s grace was begged for by the &lsquo;King,&rsquo;
and granted; and Mrs. George Harding on this night was to sing
them a song about &lsquo;poor old maidens&rsquo;&mdash;an ancient
quaintness, which, by custom and usage ever since she was a
little child, she had annually &lsquo;performed&rsquo; upon this
anniversary; and, accordingly, the promise being claimed, silence
<a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>was
obtained, and she, with all that show of tucker-heaving
diffidence which is so becoming in a pretty plump downy-cheeked
girl, prepared to commence the venerable chaunt, when a noise
resembling that produceable by the falling of an eight-and-forty
pound shot, echoed through the house.&nbsp; It appeared to
descend from the very top of the building, down each flight of
stairs rapidly and violently.&nbsp; It passed the room in which
they were sitting, and rolled its impetuous course downwards to
the basement.&nbsp; As it seemed to leave the hall, the parlour
door was forced open, as if by a rude gust of wind, and stood
ajar.</p>
<p>All the children were in a moment on their feet, huddled close
to their respective mothers in groups.&nbsp; Mrs. Harding rose
and rang the bell to inquire the meaning of the uproar.&nbsp; Her
<a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>daughter-in-law, pale as ashes, looked at George; but
there was one of the party who moved not, who stirred not; it was
the elder Harding, whose eyes first fixed steadfastly on the
half-opened door, slowly followed the course of the wall of the
apartment to the fire-place;&mdash;there they rested.</p>
<p>When the servants came, they said they had heard the noise,
but thought it proceeded from above.&nbsp; Harding looked at his
wife; and then turning to the servant, observed carelessly, that
it must have been some noise in the street, and desiring him to
withdraw, entreated the bride to pursue her song.&nbsp; She did;
but the children had been too much alarmed to enjoy it, and the
noise had in its character something so strange and so unearthly,
that even the elders of the party, although bound not to admit <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>anything
like apprehension before their offspring, felt extremely well
pleased when they found themselves at home.</p>
<p>When the guests were gone, and George&rsquo;s wife lighted her
candle to retire to rest, her father-in-law kissed her
affectionately, and prayed God to bless her.&nbsp; He then took a
kind leave of his son, and putting up a fervent prayer for his
happiness, pressed him to his heart, and bade him adieu with an
earnestness which, under the common-place circumstance of a
temporary separation, was inexplicable to the young man.</p>
<p>When Harding reached his bed-room, he spoke to his wife, and
entreated her to prepare her mind for some great calamity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What it is to be,&rsquo; said Harding, &lsquo;where the
blow is to fall I know not; but it is over us this
night!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>&lsquo;My life!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Harding,
&lsquo;what new fancy is this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eliza, love!&rsquo; answered her husband, in a tone of
unspeakable agony, &lsquo;I have seen her for the third and last
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Martha</span>, <span
class="smcap">the Gipsy</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impossible,&rsquo; said Mrs. Harding, &lsquo;you have
not left the house to-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, my beloved,&rsquo; replied the husband;
&lsquo;but I have seen her.&nbsp; When that tremendous noise was
heard at supper, as the door was supernaturally opened, I saw
her.&nbsp; She fixed those dreadful eyes of her&rsquo;s upon me;
she proceeded to the fire-place, and stood in the midst of the
children, and there she remained till the servant came
in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dearest husband,&rsquo; said Mrs. Harding,
&lsquo;this is but a disorder of the imagination!&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>&lsquo;Be it what it may,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I have
seen her.&nbsp; Human or superhuman&mdash;natural or
supernatural&mdash;there she was.&nbsp; I shall not strive to
argue upon a point where I am likely to meet with little credit:
all I ask is, pray fervently, have faith, and we will hope the
misfortune, whatever it is, may be averted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He kissed his wife&rsquo;s cheek tenderly, and after a fitful
feverish hour or two fell into a slumber.</p>
<p>From that slumber never awoke he more.&mdash;He was found dead
in his bed in the morning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether the force of imagination, coupled with the
unexpected noise, produced such an alarm as to rob him of life, I
know not,&rsquo; said my communicant; &lsquo;but he was
dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The story was told me by my friend Ellis in walking from the
City to <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>Harley-street late one evening; and when we came to
this part of the history we were in Bedford-square, at the dark
and dreary corner of it where Caroline-street joins it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And there,&rsquo; said Ellis, pointing downward,
&lsquo;is the street where the circumstance occurred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, come,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;you tell the story
well, but I suppose you do not expect it to be received as
gospel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Faith,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I know so much of it that
I was one of the twelfth-night party, and heard the
noise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you did not see the spectre?&rsquo; cried I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Ellis, &lsquo;I certainly did
not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor anybody else,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be
sworn.&rsquo;&mdash;A quick footstep was just then heard behind
us.&mdash;I turned half round <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>to let the person pass, and saw a
woman enveloped in a red cloak, whose sparkling black eyes, shone
upon by the dim lustre of a lamp above her head, dazzled
me.&mdash;I was startled&mdash;&lsquo;Pray remember old <span
class="smcap">Martha</span>, <span class="smcap">the
Gipsy</span>,&rsquo; said the hag.</p>
<p>It was like a thunder-stroke.&mdash;I instantly slipped my
hand into my pocket, and hastily gave her three from a
five-shilling piece.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, my bonny one,&rsquo; said the woman, and
setting up a shout of contemptuous laughter she bounded down
Caroline-street towards Russell-street, singing, or rather
yelling a wild air.</p>
<p>Ellis did not speak during this scene&mdash;he pressed my arm
tightly, and we quickened our pace.&nbsp; We said nothing to each
other till we turned into Bedford-street, and the lights and <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>passengers
of Tottenham-court-road re-assured us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you think of <i>that</i>?&rsquo; said Ellis to
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Seeing is believing</i>,&rsquo; was my reply.</p>
<p>I have never passed that dark corner of Bedford-square in the
evening since.</p>
<h2><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>REMARKABLE FULFILMENT OF A PREDICTION.</h2>
<p>A certain German author relates the following:</p>
<p>In my younger days, there was a dinner given in the
<i>Florenburg Westphalen</i>, where I was born, on the occasion
of a baptism to which a clergyman was invited.&nbsp; During
dinner, the conversation turned upon the gravedigger of the
place, who was well known on account of his second-sight; for, as
often as he saw a corpse, he was always telling that there would
be a funeral from such and such a house.&nbsp; Now, as the event
invariably took place, the inhabitants of the house he indicated
were placed by the man&rsquo;s tale in the greatest anxiety.</p>
<p><a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>This
man&rsquo;s prophecying was an abomination to the
clergyman.&nbsp; He therefore forbade him, but all to no purpose;
for the poor dolt, although he was a drunkard, and a man of low
and vulgar sentiments, believed firmly that it was a prophetic
gift of God, and that he must make it known, in order that the
people might still repent.&nbsp; At length the clergyman gave him
notice that, if he announced one funeral more, he should be
deprived of his place, and expelled from the village.&nbsp; This
availed&mdash;the gravedigger was silent from that time
forward.&nbsp; Half a year afterward, in the autumn of 1745, the
gravedigger came to the clergyman, and said to him: &lsquo;Sir,
you have forbidden me to announce any more funerals, and I have
not done so since, nor will I do it any more; but I must tell you
something that is particularly <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>remarkable, that you may see that my
second sight is really true.&nbsp; In a few weeks a corpse will
be brought up the meadow, which will be drawn on a sledge by an
ox.&rsquo;&nbsp; The clergyman seemingly paid no attention to
this, but listened to it with indifference, and replied:
&lsquo;Only go about your business, and leave off such
superstitious follies.&nbsp; It is sinful to have anything to do
with them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some weeks after a strong body of Austrian troops passed
through the village on their way to the Netherlands.&nbsp; While
resting there a day, the snow fell nearly three feet deep.&nbsp;
At the same time, a woman died in another village of the same
parish.&nbsp; The military took away all the horses out of the
country to drag the waggons.&nbsp; Meanwhile the corpse lay
there, no horses came back; <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>the body began to putrify; they
were, therefore, compelled to make a virtue of necessity&mdash;to
place the corpse upon a sledge, and harness an ox to it.</p>
<p>In the meantime the clergyman, and the teacher with his
scholars, proceeded to the village to meet the corpse; and, as
the funeral came along the meadow in this array, the gravedigger
came up to the clergyman, pulled him by the gown, pointed with
his finger toward the sledge, and said not a word.</p>
<p>Such was the tale as related by the clergyman.&nbsp; I was
well acquainted with the good man, and he was incapable of
telling an untruth, much less in a matter which contradicted all
his principles.</p>

254</span>PROVIDENTIAL FOREBODING.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the &lsquo;Museum of
Wonders,&rsquo; Vol. II., page 153, there is a striking
presentiment related, which Madame de Beaumont received from the
lips of a credible person.&nbsp; This individual had a friend in
the country, who, being unmarried, committed his domestic
concerns to the care of an housekeeper who had been with him for
many years.&nbsp; When his birthday arrived, he made many
preparations for celebrating it, and told his housekeeper in the
morning to clean out a certain arbour in the garden, which he
named, because, as the weather was fine, he intended to pass the
day in it with his guests.&nbsp; She seeming quite amazed at
this, told and entreated him to receive his guests in a room, for
she <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>had
last night in her dream a presentiment that the arbour would that
day be struck by lightning.&nbsp; He laughed at the assertion, as
there was no appearance of a storm coming on that day, and he
told her not to mind her foolish dream, and to prepare the arbour
for the reception of his guests.&nbsp; She did as she was
ordered, the guests arrived, and as the day was fine, made
themselves merry.&nbsp; But in the meantime clouds gathered in
the distant horizon and were at last powerfully driven to that
place by the wind.&nbsp; The company were so intent on their
entertainment that they did not in the least observe it: but
scarcely was the housekeeper aware that the storm was
approaching, than she begged her master to leave the arbour with
his company, for she could not divest herself at all of the idea
of the lightning striking it.&nbsp; At <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>first they
would not listen, but at last, when she continued her entreaties
and the thunder commenced to approach with great violence, they
suffered themselves to be induced to leave the arbour.&nbsp;
Hardly had they reached the room when they heard a heavy crash of
thunder, and the quick following lightning struck the arbour and
dashed everything that had been left in it to pieces.</p>
<h2>WONDERFUL PRESENTIMENT.</h2>
<p>Madame Beaumont relates the following:</p>
<p>My whole family still remember an accident from which my
father was preserved by a presentiment of danger.&nbsp; On one
occasion, he agreed with a party to sail to Port St. Osmer.&nbsp;
When it was time to go on board, an aunt of my father&rsquo;s,
who was deaf and dumb, uttered a kind of howl, placed herself at
the door, <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>blocked up the way with her arms, struck her hands
together, and gave him, by signs, to understand that she conjured
him to stay at home.&nbsp; My father, who had promised himself
much pleasure from this excursion, only laughed at her
entreaties; but the lady fell at his feet, and manifested such
signs of poignant grief, that he at length determined to yield to
her entreaties, and postponed his excursion to Port St. Osmer
until some other day.</p>
<p>He therefore endeavoured to detain the rest also; but they
laughed at him for being so easily persuaded, and set sail.&nbsp;
Scarcely had the vessel proceeded half the distance, before those
on board of it had the greatest reason to repent that they had
not followed his advice.&nbsp; Some serious accidents happened to
the vessel, so that it broke to pieces; several lost their lives,
and those who saved <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>themselves by swimming were so much
terrified at their narrow escape, that they, with difficulty, got
the better of it.</p>
<p>By some written statements the dumb afterwards made, it was
shown that, in the night preceding, she had an awful and
life-like dream, in which it seemed that the excursion-boat,
which would set sail on the following day for Port St. Osmer,
would be wrecked; and that most of the persons on board would
either get drowned or barely escape.&nbsp; The warning angel
found that he could influence no one more effectually than the
deaf and dumb aunt; he therefore selected her for the execution
of his commission.&nbsp; My father, all his life, was profoundly
thankful, both to her and the guardian angel, for this
providential warning and foreboding.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
